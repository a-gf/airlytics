The staff is not the nicest and are simply rude - no customer service skills at all. On my way to the Galápagos Islands, my flight was pretty much empty and a family with a baby wanted to sit together, being that their row was empty, the flight attendants refused them sitting next to each other - where as other airlines do not have a problem with that. Mind you this was all in the same economy cabin, no one was trying to upgrade their cabin, simply just sit next to one another. On my way back from Galapagos, my flight again was not fully packed and in one of the overhead bins, there were many book bags and a small space where I attempted to put my large should bag. There wasn’t space for another book bag or carry on suitcase but there was just enough room for my shoulder bag, to which the flight attendant basically yelled at me for and asked to take it down. 5 minutes later, the overhead bin which I attempted to put my bag in, was closed with no other bags put in. I am dissatisfied with the customer service of this airline. Not even mentioning that they won’t offer you a simple cup of water unless you pay $4. My family traveled from NY to Ecuador, which is a 6 hour flight, they also complained about not even being offered water or a snack. Absolutely ridiculous. I traveled from Colombia to Ecuador which was an hour flight with LATAM and was given a drink and two snacks.

Even though the flight was ""only"" less than 4 hours, your mind projects this discomfort as one full eternity in hell. Nobody taller than 180cm will enjoy the ride, unless they love suffering and narrow spaces. I'm 185cm and my knees kept pushing into the metal parts of the hand rests in front of me (window seat). I was just lucky that there was a much small person sitting next to me that did not need as much space. The moment you put 3 people above 180cm next to each other, it's game over. I don't care about the onboard service because most of the time I bring my own snacks for the journey. I don't care about onboard entertainment for the same reason. I only care about the basic comfort (not even higher echelons of comfort that Karens would be fighting teeth and nails to get) but Avianca fails to deliver even this basic thing. It's honestly sad.

They lied when they said that the airport was closed because 5-10 minutes after the scheduled departure time for my flight, two flights, one from Avianca and the other from LAN, flew from Medellin to Bogota. My itinerary was re-routed through Bogota, San Salvador and finally to San Jose, Costa Rica arriving there around 10 pm.

Not much explanation given to me. When I complained to the supervisor about the situation, she asked me if I had my Yellow Fever vaccination certificate available. I had already checked in and no one from Avianca asked me for this vaccine, but she was the only one that asked me this question. The idea was to punish me for complaining and for trying to get a ticket with Copa. It looks like they are not used to passengers complaining about the service. Fortunately I had my vaccination certificate and was able to take the plane. Another thing that happened to me that demonstrates how disorganized Avianca is, was that when I made a route change two days before taking the flight, Avianca charged me for the departure fee from Colombia (I’m a US citizen), even though I didn’t have to pay for it. They return the money at the airport before taking the flight. In spite of flying for more than 25 years to Latin America and accumulating more than 3 million miles, I haven’t traveled with Avianca extensively.

Of course, they wouldn't pay accommodation or anything else either. When trying to discuss options with them, they simply hang up. Finally, many passengers opted to take the bus and claim the money later on (good luck with the claim, anyway). Unfortunately, they have the monopoly of many flight routes in the country and there is no competition, so they charge whatever they like for a very poor service. They not only cancel flights with no notice, half of the time there is a strike or some other reason to leave people stranded.

I waited on the phone for 30 minutes the day before my flight to reserve seats for the flights and when I showed up to the airport they had no record of my phone call (even though I had gotten an email with seat confirmation) and they had already given away our seats. Given that we had an international flight on our itinerary, we were entitled to two checked bags for each of our flight legs, and every single time they tried to charge us and we had to remind them that we got two free bags - I think they were trying to dupe us. What was most frustrating was that they cancelled our flight home with just over 24 hours advance notice because of a ""technical difficulty"" with the plane, and instead of having the direct flight from Buenos Aires to JFK that we paid for, they re-booked us (after 1 hour on hold) on a flight to New Jersey. I had a connection from JFK to Boston that I obviously missed, and ended up having to pay for another very expensive flight. I filed a claim and never heard back. I called once to follow up and after 45 minutes on hold I was promised that all claims were addressed within 22 days. 22 days came and went and I never heard back again. I made four additional follow-up phone calls, and each time I was on hold from anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes before I could speak to someone. Every person I spoke to gave a different explanation - from this is the wrong phone number to claims take 2 months (not 22 days) to call Expedia. When I finally started asking to speak to supervisors, two times I was actually hung up on.

Has to be the worse product flying from South America to the US. Here's why: Product - dated angle-flat seats on a 2-2-2 set up. Most seats were worn out and clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while. Amenity kit very basic and neither the bag or products were branded (vs Coke Hann on AA, Tumi on Delta, Ferragamo on LATAM etc) Food - much less than basic. On the return I was better off having a quick meal at the airport than on the plane. Service - here's my major concern, if I'm paying a lot for business class, I expect friendly service and attention to detail. Anything I wanted I had to ask for it, they would take my glass of wine while they were still half empty and wouldn't ask if I wanted a refill. I had my food tray done for a long time before they picked up Entertainment - basic, ~30 movies (most of them old or Argentinian films). Forget about noise cancelling headphones.

The only reason why we were helped was that we complain so much and remained at the check-in window requesting somebody to help us with our flights, we had to ignore the negative treatment by some of the staff and their management and just held our position until someone decided to help us and put us on a flight - we arrived to our destinations after losing 1 day on our holiday; and upon our return discovered that after that whole situation Aerolineas Argentinas cancelled our return flights which had nothing to do with the original flights impacted by the strike.

Very modern plane with LED ambience lighting, good entertainment screens with a good selection of movies and music. Sounds great so far right? Well, the downfall begins with the amount of leg room Aerolineas Argentinas have on this plane. I take long haul flights at least 3 times a year and have had experiences with various airlines but I have never seen a plane with such little space as this one. It was really uncomfortable the whole time because of the limited leg room (I am 1,79 cm). Unlike my other flight on this trip with Aerolineas, the food served for dinner was horrible, I didn't eat it at all, worst food I have ever seen on a long haul flight and I heard other passengers complaining about it as well. Breakfast was decent but still overall very disappointed.

I was not sure what to expect, because reviews are very mixed. Both stretches were flown on their A340. On the outbound route, the seats were very old/outdated, although reasonably comfortable. The in-flight system was very limited with just 4 movies and not the best. On the inbound flight we had a different plane and the seats looked much better, although overall they were the same type, but the video screens were much larger. There was also a bigger choice in movies. On both flights the cabin crew was very attentive and pleasant. The meals, although quite abundant, were mediocre in taste, and in both cases, something or the other was forgotten (like the dressing). Bread was cold and/or stale. My biggest point of criticism was the check-in. I had a carry-on weighing 12.3 kilos. First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed. The last check-in agent just walked away with leaving passengers in the SkyPriority line without saying anything. When I complained to the girl who did check me in at an economy counter, she said I had arrived just during a schedule change (how weird!). All in all it was a mixed bag with the actual flight a much better experience than the experience on the ground. To me their way of dealing with business class passenger in the check-in procedure leave much (!) to be desired. They did not treat us special, on the contrary. It was fussy to say the least.",3,3,0,A340,Aerolíneas Argentinas

We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job.

I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,2,1,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours. I would not recommend Aerolineas economy to anyone.,3,1,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

EZE-SYD - delayed 16 hours initially for heavy rain in BA then they needed fresh crew then the new crew arrived late then missed curfew at Sydney airport.

The food was not great but reasonable for economy. I had to change my flight by 2 days going back Aerolineas made that very expensive for me. The return flight was very poorly organised. Check in was extremely slow with unnecessary delays. Subsequently the take off was delayed 2.5 hours without explanation. The flight itself was uneventful with the aircraft arriving 3.5 hours late. Movies on board were the same as on the flight to BA and were repeated. Meals were minimal. No drinks were offered in between meals.,2,2,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

Average flight nothing special. Arrived in Buenos Aires at 5.30 am and went to our assigned gate at the domestic terminal. We were booked on Flight 1880 to Ushuaia that was to leave at 7.45 am (12/19/13) giving 30 hours to catch our 3pm (12/20/13) Antarctic cruise. Fl 1880 was postponed to 8.50 then to 10.30 without explanation. Then told the flight would leave at 3 pm. The flight didn't leave at 3.00 we were then told 8.30pm. What happened at 8.30 pm the postponed time for the scheduled flight is something out of a movie. We were never told that the flight was cancelled we were just told the flight would not be taking off. 2 hours later we were transported by bus out to the tarmac to board our plane to Ushuaia. After stopping at Trelow and taking on more passengers we were scheduled to arrive in Ushuaia about 2 am on 12/20. Landed at a small airport. The captain then for the first time announced that we were in El Calafete instead of Ushuaia. In the early morning hours of the 20th we are waiting in an unscheduled airport not knowing when or if we would arrive in Ushuaia. 2 hours later we board a plane and much to our relief we arrived in Ushuaia at 6am. Needless to say we did arrive at our cruise on time but we had one change of clothes to last us a whole 8 day cruise. We were never offered an explanation for the postponed and cancelled flights and then were diverted to a different airport without warning or explanation.

One of the internal flights was cancelled due to a strike by airport staff (Puente de Aereo - Buenos Aires). We had to queue for 6 hours to speak to a representative (during a heat wave where the temperature was close to 40 degrees C). When we did finally reach the front of the queue we were offered an alternative flight for 5 days after the original flight date and were not offered any compensation in terms of a snack or alternative accommodation. Their attitude throughout was ""it's your problem"". On our final flight back to Bogota they changed the flight time from 6.30am to 5.20am around a month before the flight. We turned up 3 hours before the flight as instructed on the ticket only to find no check-in staff present. We waited 1 hour before a single representative turned up and when I asked why staff weren't present to check us in at the time that we were requested to be there I was told ""it's very early"". This was another example of their attitude towards customers. As a result the flight was delayed by 2 hours.

The flight attendants had such a bad attitude and passengers flicked on the service light for the entire flight and not once did I see someone respond. They basically served dinner and then left the cabin for the entire time until breakfast. I was dehydrated and not feeling well and wanted some water and didn't see anyone come so being that I was in the window seat I flicked the service light and after an hour of waiting I finally went to look for someone all the way at the back of the plane and they were all sleeping (it was 7pm).

Multiple FAA safety violations. Example: people standing while the aircraft was moving luggage obstructing the pitch during take-off and landing etc. Service was awful. In addition to leaving 5 hours late it took them 2-3 hours to serve the first drink. When they finally came by with drinks I ordered a whisky. The flight attendant explained they did not serve whisky until after lunch and that that she did not have any whisky in her cart. She did not have the Shiraz wine that they listed on their menu either so I settled for whichever red wine she could give me. Lunch was mediocre and immediately after the service all flight attendant disappeared for about 7 hours until they brought the ""snack"". Not even a glass of water throughout the flight. Finally while sleeping the flight attendant woke me up because the back of my seat was ""bothering"" the passenger behind me probably because the seat was ""defective and reclined too much"".

Calling the Call Center to try to find out what to expect once in Ezeiza (stranded for 24 hours with two young kids? sent to a hotel? put in a different flight from the domestic airport?) was total waste of time.

If you wanted anything they were more than obliging to help. Will definitely fly AR again.,5,2,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

I had no problems at all during the flight. No delays service wasn't that bad and staff were friendly. I wasn't able to eat the food served because my agent (nothing to do with AA) forgot to send the request for vegetarian food (must be done when the booking is made) and they didn't have much options for non- meat eaters.

It is obviously an airline of a country in economic crisis. Aircraft used on the SYD-EZE-SYD route is like stepping back into 1975. Big old recliner seats (not flat) 3 scheduled movies on a continuous loop. No laptop power etc. The service is very basic to other carriers. AA club condor service is similar to what's offered in economy on other carriers. This is an extremely long flight close to 16 hours yet AA still doesn't use their brand new Airbus with lie flat beds I believe this is used to Madrid and back for obvious reasons. The crew on all sectors didn't really want to be there. EZE-SYD is one of the longest flights in the world made even longer by the aircraft and the service.

Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.,4,2,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

Was told 3 weeks before the flight it would be delayed 20 mins - got to the Airport it was shown to be 1 hr delay but eventually the 8.30am flight departed at 11am. Food was dreadful but this time could get more than 1 glass of wine. There was no explanation as to why the flight was delayed. Experienced similar on Austral (a subsidiary) had to be there 2hrs before and it still departed late. Iguazu-Salta cheese sandwich offered which was thicker - the bread or cheese?

There was no facility for web check-in or to have our seats pre-allocated prior to check-in. We arrived more than 2 hours prior to the flight to be told that the only way we could sit together was to take 2 middle seats in the centre row of the plane. The A340 has a 2-4-2 configuration. In such a configuration 50% of the seats are aisle seats. However it appeared that almost all had been pre-allocated prior to the ordinary check-in opening. In the end we were offered an aisle and a middle seat in the very back row. It is time that Aerolineas recognized that families are entitled to expect to sit together on long haul flights without having to take the worst seats on the plane.

Only use AR to get from SYD to EZE if you can't avoid it! The seats are rock hard but with better leg room than many. No on-line check-in or seat selection. No early bag drops on transfers meaning I had to wait for 3 hours at EZE before passing through immigration. (At 2am.) No in-seat entertainment and the two in-cabin screens-and sound - only worked part of the time. The same low res movies shown in both directions. The food coming back from EZE was the worst I have ever had on an airline with a tiny dried-up croissant tiny hard roll and insipid yoghurt offered as breakfast and pasta with a teaspoon of tasteless tomato sauce for lunch. I could not even get any pepper when I asked. Red wine was good though. Food out of SYD was much better. Excellent new terminal C at Ezeiza and 57 nice new aircraft in Argentina - pity these advancements don't extend to the Australian part of the operation.

Food was ok with snacks and drinks which you had to get yourself. Great views of the Antarctica if only the staff would let us see most of the flight the shades were kept down.

Flying to and from Sydney the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The plane seemed very old. Inflight entertainment poor quality TV and screen. Food was just bearable. The only flight that left on time was the one out of Sydney. First and last time flying with AA. Delay in BA to Santiago due to not wanting to fuel the plane in the rain. Delay from Santiago to BA no idea why. A supposed delay of 22 mins which turned into just over an hour from BA to Sydney which caused me to miss my connecting flight. So overall not happy with the experience. Also trying to check in at Santiago to fly to BA took the check-in lady well over half an hour. Real disappointment for a holiday I had waited 1 year for.,1,1,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

The aircraft used for this route are old but seats are as comfortable as other airline's with more legroom than most. The meals were adequate if not great with ample self serve snacks. Drinks available throughout the flight and the service was polite and friendly. Taking my own entertainment (on a tablet) was no problem considering the savings being made on the price of the tickets compared to the prices charged by the competition. I also caught several Aerolineas regional flights in South America on new aircraft as it is are in the process of adding new aircraft to its fleet.,3,2,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.,4,1,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.,1,0,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

The lack of IFE was an obvious flaw but my tablet computer lasted the whole journey so it was ok. The food wasn't great but the white wine was superb.

I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.,3,0,0,Not specified,Aerolíneas Argentinas

Finally when we boarded it took another hour to take off! The people on my flight were complaining of the terrible service they had already experienced with Aerolineas. When I arrived in Sydney I had missed my connecting flight and so had half of the passengers I was with. We all had to pay for new tickets to our next destination which cost me $170 to Melbourne!

Plane is an older A340-200 - without personal IFE - just a main screen. Economy class seats were generously sized and I was offered an emergency exit seat from SYD-EZE. EZE-SYD was a standard economy class seat. Plane departed on time from SYD-EZE and again EZE-SYD. Staff friendly and always walking around. Food was edible but there wasn't much of it. A small self-serve bar in the galley provided water and snacks during the flight. Both flights the plane landed on time and overall was a pleasant experience. Despite being limited in features I got from SYD to EZE and back cheaply comfortably and if you bring your iPad/iPod you'll be entertained. If there was no price difference between AR and LAN/Qantas etc. consider going on the latter. But AR isn't a bad airline provided you've got some personal entertainment on the long 13-15 hour flights. One final point - the AR website is incredibly hard to navigate and use.

Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on.

Both long-haul legs were close to being on time but the baggage wait in BA was around 40 min (thus missed the transfer bus to the other airport in BA and had to get a cab). Upon arrival at AEP I was checked-in for the flight to Rio as normal. But 20 min after the schedule boarding time everyone was informed that AR decided to switch the departing airport back to EZE (and this is already at 10pm). So had to re-clear the custom collect our baggage wait for 30 min for the bus take the 1 hour bus ride to the other side of the town re-check in and re-clear the custom at EZE (which took 1 hour). Finally landed in Rio at 3.30am 4 hours late. No compensation was offered whatsoever. The return flights were relatively stress-free. Overall the cabin service was above average but planes are antiquated with no personal entertainment but a leaky roof.

I checked- in and everything was confirmed with my seat etc. I was at the airport at 6am for the 8.30am flight. After 1 hour in line I was only half way down the queue. A little bit later other passengers bound for SYD were denied access. The following reason was given: the weather pattern on the route to SYD. Therefore they had to get rid of weight to have a lighter aircraft to make it the entire way. Later we learnt that they had given freight/cargo priority and consequently 80 of us were stranded with the next flight due 3 days later which only had 40 free spots. The employees only spoke Spanish which was hard for people who didn't know the language. Lots of ideas were thrown around but evidently the flight left without us. I had checked the flight the days/weeks before I was due to fly it and noticed that the flight always left EZE delayed by 1-2 hours which could be for similar reasons. Maybe they should go back to flying via AKL to be able to accept all the paid passengers.

And the movie they played was in Spanish. Dinner was acceptable. Kids had a kids meal as requested. It was disappointing there was no beverage service during the night for those who were awake.

This was made worse by a number of issues at the airport and poor staff customer services: Poor communications and updates, no reason given and no idea of when the next flight. It turns out that the plane for that flight was re-directed to do a different route. Staff either refused to communicate or did not know what was going on - keep saying we were going to leave in an hour or 90 mins and it turned out to be 8 hours. we then waited for the crew to come on a later flight that evening to man a plane that was already there to take us back.

Avianca staff, fully aware the flight was overbooked and the overhead bins were destined to overflow, didn’t even bother offering to check bags proactively. The boarding process was next, and let’s just say “organized” wasn’t on the menu. Boarding groups? Pure fiction. The announcement was made, and it was every passenger for themselves. Once onboard, there was a 20-minute wait in the jet bridge. The seat barely had enough legroom to accommodate a hamster, and the cushion was so thin. The overhead bins reserved for suitcases with wheels. Winter coats are apparently considered unworthy of such luxury. The flight attendants weren’t in the mood for smiles or pleasantries. There was complimentary water but only if you were brave enough to venture to the back of the plane and help yourself.  The paid menu was so uninspired. The highlight of the service was the single crew member responsible for selling the menu items.  Needless to say, by the time my turn came around, I’d lost the will to gamble on an overpriced sandwich. By the end of this six-hour endurance test, I was questioning every life choice that led me to book this flight.

If you are savvy enough you will find a recommendation to make a screenshot of how broken it is to present it at the counter at the airport so they can consider waiving the at-counter check in charge. That is, if your booking even truly exists. I was booked on a codeshare flight that did not exist and that has happened twice already. So let's say you get to the counter and your flight actually does exist, the next thing you can enjoy is the check-in agent trying to shake a few pesitos out of you if you are the wrong colour and speak the wrong language. The baggage limits get made up on the spot and the most significant carrier rule is always being spat on. Regarding cabin class, don't even bother with business for domestic. It simply does not exist (lie), you will be bumped back to economy and will be able to enjoy buying an reserved seat for abysmal prices. The ""business"" class does exist, it just doesn't matter if your codeshare flight booking says it or not. In Avianca's eyes, if you didn't book with them and didn't pay them directly, you should be taped to the wing or fly in the cargo hold. They will very vocally deny that there is a business class, any and all complaints about downgrade will be suggested to be printed out, folded several times, oiled up and stuck up an orifice of choice. Before departing the counter, if your check in agent is honest enough, you will have the actual departure time handwritten on your boarding pass. They know they are departing hours late - good luck with your short layover, if applicable. Next, you will indeed find out that the actual departure times are a mystery only known do masters of dark arcane magic and forest sages. If your flight exists and is scheduled to depart at all on that day, that is. It's not only when, but also a matter of if the plane departs, you see. Mild riots at departure gates are a common sight in Colombian airports for Avianca. If you have somehow survived this far, you will see a very proud sticker on the plane, saying they are the most punctual airline according to whatchamacallit. I can't help but wonder how massive the bribe was in this case. I have never seen an Avianca flight depart on time and the times I have unfortunately been on one must be over 10 by now. I had a small chuckle, followed by despair since I knew what was coming next. What follows is a very disorganized and stretched out boarding, filling an A320 can take close to an hour sometimes. I don't even know how. And for whatever reason someone always gets deboarded close to door closure. Waiting for you inside is a chair that is just not meant for anyone not suffering from dwarfism or having a spinal column. A burlap sack of field rocks would make a better seat honestly. The overhead bins will be full of luggage unless you somehow manage to be one of the first few people to get on board, so you have to chuck your belongings under the seat. Again, unless you are fun sized, this will cause legroom issues. Even the emergency row can have anyone taller than 170 to have their kneecaps smashed in by the seat in front even without reclining. Speaking of cramped, the restroom is behind one of the jumpseats so the cabin crew will make it visibly and audibly clear to you that you are not welcome there - since they have to stand up for your relief break. And I had my shoulders touch walls in the restroom - I am a humble 180cm and in normal bodyweight.",0,0,0,A320,Avianca

""Business class"" is more like economy plus (at best) with the middle seat blocked. In any event, when we went to check in we were told that there was a ""problem"" with our payment and that our seat selection had been cancelled. When I produced documents showing acceptance of my payment, and my ticket with the assigned business class seat, the story changed and ""somehow"" Avianca had cancelled out seats and given them away to another customer while retaining our $75 per person seat fee. Therefore, we learned at 1:00 AM that we had no assigned seat on the 3:15 AM flight! The gate agent informed us that no business class seats remained and put us in a regular economy row with no middle seat between us, as the best he could do. Somehow, on the same transaction, they managed to assign us the exit row seats we had paid for on the Bogota to Miami leg of the journey. Of course I notified Avianca on our return for the $75 per person refund, and they have yet to respond. Since I charged the tickets (of course!) I am also disputing it with the credit card company, and if Avianca does not respond to them by a certain date, the amount will be refunded to us. In this case it is not the amount so much as the sheer incompetency of Avianca. I have never heard of anyone having upgraded seats cancelled on one leg of a flight with no real explanation except ""something happened"" and of course, no subsequent communication from the airline.

An overbooked flight made a rocky start for AV26 to Madrid, in which there was somewhat of a brawl between airline staff and passengers who had the misfortune of being randomly selected to be offloaded and rebooked in AV10, a flight which departed around 6 hours later. Anyway, I was lucky to get to keep in the crammed seat that I had payed for, and although the 787 is a comfortable plane, avianca’s recent densification of the plane means that legroom is painfully tight for me (182 cms) and padding is practically nonexistent. In other words, getting up from the seat is a pain, but so is staying on it! Food was exceptionally dreadful (like 80’s bad) and the crew also went out of their way to be as rude and unfriendly as they possibly could. Either the call buttons are broken, or nobody bothers to go see the passenger in need of something.

Over the years, I have seen previously good service decay into mediocrity. But today was different. I’ve had enough, and am now looking looking for status match options with competitors. Today, booked from Orlando to Bogotá in “Flex” (Avianca’s most expensive fare for this specific route/ $620 round trip/ 3.5h flights), I was greeted by some extremely rude staff at Avianca’s check in at Orlando Airport. Although, thanks to my Star Alliance Gold (Avianca Diamond) status I have a complimentary sports equipment, for the first time ever, I was ordered to open the wakeboard’s case and show it. Afterwards, I was told that, due to the fact that in the wakeboard’s case there also were a couple of damp swimsuits, this was no longer considered a sports equipment and therefore would be charged as an oversized bag ($100). In order to comply with the rude employee’s nonsensical and ridiculous requirement that there only fly the sports equipment within the case, I asked her to check it in. At that point she stopped again, this time to take out a measuring tape and ask me for the $100 oversize fee anyway, as the wakeboard exceeded allowed measurements by about two inches. After asking for some rationality, I was insulted by the supervisor, threatened to have my reservation canceled, and forced into oblivion. Upon boarding, even in the Star Alliance Gold line, me and my fellow frequent flyers were barked at by another equally rude employee into measuring our luggage in a low cost airline-style fitter. After my “personal item” (an average sized backpack) barely exceeded the allowed measurements and would be of no difference to anyone, as it flies under the seat in front, I was ordered to gate-check it for the hefty fee of another $120. After mentioning, once again my status, the unnoticeability of the excess in size, and the cost of the fare I had purchased, I was told literally that they “couldn't care less” and that, should I not pay immediately, I would be reported as an unruly passenger and be denied boarding. Apart from the absolute antithesis of basic costumer service, the outrageousness of the employee’s blatant lack of respect, and the little to no courtesy Avianca showed towards me and other costumers, I wound up paying $840 dollars for a round trip of 3.5h flights on a painfully uncomfortable economy seat with unnoticeable recline with a blocked middle, and absolutely no complimentary service (even water was charged) and a couple of insults. I have flown low cost airlines extensively both in Europe and the US. I have never had such a terrible experience, let alone for the price and frequent flyer status I hold. I would suggest fellow travelers to go out of their way in avoiding Avianca: If you’ve purchased one of their more “permissive fares” or got frequent flyer status with them or any Star Alliance partner, they “couldn’t care less about it”.

Unfortunately we chose row 11. Row 11 does not recline. However, row 10 does. (Think about that before choosing a row 11 seat on this A320.) The designers did not take this into consideration when deciding on how much legroom to give the passengers seated in row 11. Apparently none of the economy seats recline (those are the ones beyond the 10th row). So rows 12 to 30 do not suffer from reduced legroom when the passengers in front of them recline their seats, because the passengers in front of them can’t recline their seats. Avianca does not serve a meal on this flight, we talking about an international flight, that takes off at 10 AM and lands at 2PM (as in: “lunchtime”). Sure, this is becoming a common theme with airlines, but most offer food for purchase. Avianca did offer some snacks and sandwiches for sale, but only stocked enough for the first 9 rows. By the time the attendants got their cart to the 11th row they were out of all the sandwiches and croissants. Keep in mind that this A320 has 30 rows… The movie and TV selections were very limited. I usually fly AA which by comparison offers a wide selection of entertainment.

After dealing with relatively unhelpful, officious and rude agents each of the three of us were only grudgingly given the option to rebook to a much later flight for a ""penalty"" that was almost the cost of a whole new ticket.

I was traveling with two members of my family. On the day of check-in, I tried to add my TSA Known Traveler Number through the website, but the website denied the number; this was not the first time that'd happened. I called customer service to add this since that was what I did last time. Customer service said that they could not add it, and that I would have to go directly to the counter at the airport (let it be known that they added it the previous couple of times with minimal problem). On the day of the flight, we got to the counter, and as always, the staff on the counter seemed to have a bad day so far. We had one checked bag and were only allowed one personal item; the lady on the counter ""nicely"" checked what kind of personal items we had, and we were ready to go. I asked if I could add my TSA number, but the lady said that the system was not allowing her to add it and that I would have to speak directly with TSA (no problem-solving whatsoever). I asked TSA and they said that the airline had to deal with that. I did not want more problems, so I went with my family through regular TSA. We got to the gate and were waiting to board the plane; one of my family members has a back problem, so she took a backpack with rollers.  Once we started boarding, the lady at the gate stopped my family member and said she could not board the plane. We got checked in with my other family member and waited in the hall before entering the plane. Staff started complaining about her personal item, stating it was a carry-on. I asked them to measure the backpack because it was a personal item. There was another lady at the counter of the gate yelling at me that my family member would not board and fly; I told her multiple times it was a backpack and to measure it, but she was rubbing her face, annoyed, and responding that she would not board the plane, she was responding with an attitude and with annoyed faces.  I tried to exit the hall, but the lady at the gate stopped me, saying that I would be off-boarded off the plane and that they would call the police; they told us several times they'd call the police (I'm unsure why, but anyhow). I asked her to measure the backpack, and her response was to recite the measurements and that they would take care of it, and we needed to board the plane. We left my family member at the gate and boarded the plane. My family member then told us they were asking for $150.00 for the personal item (as usual), and my family member asked to speak with the manager. The manager came out saying that the backpack was again a carry-on, but she proceeded to measure it. To their not-so-surprise, the backpack was the measurement of a carry on. Then they complained about why the tickets were bought separately and why she was separated from the family. To this point, I think they were stretching it. My family member told them that that had nothing to do with her not boarding the plane. The staff then asked my family member to remove some stuff from her bag because it was too big, saying she'd leave it.

Me sitting first row after emergency exit with lesser seat pitch and non reclining seat (which you get when not wanting to pay extra for a regular coach seat) didn’t even bother, but a fellow passenger asked crew whether he could move one row up, where no one was sitting. The answer was yes but with payment of 50 USD as it is a comfort seat (emergency exit rows). Now, not to comment here Avianca’s tacky approach, but rather the fact we left, flew and landed with no one sitting any emergency exit row. This obviously because of some money making policy.

You're already there, what are you going to do other than hand over your credit card? On my latest trip I unsuccessfully attempted to log my 2nd bag 5 days prior to my Avianca flight, before leaving home on United, and was charged $50 for my 2nd (small) bag to Houston. ""Go to the airport counter"" is always the default non-answer from the app. At online check-in, both with mobile app and on my laptop I got the same answer, even after enduring multiple crashes and reinstalling the mobile app. At the airport counter bag drop I was charged $220 for the 2nd bag. It's a small and light carry-on size, and tiny compared to the large 2nd bags that other passengers were dropping off. The agent stated that passengers are supposed to inform Avianca 48 hrs in advance to receive a special 2nd bag fee of $100  which is already crazy expensive. If you check in at 24 hrs preflight you're unable to log any extra bags and must go to the counter, however I am doubtful the app would have worked at 48 hrs prior, because it never works. The young agent at the counter was difficult and unyielding.

Further, when I purchased food, I was given an inedible instant Mac and cheese (improperly made, don’t offer it if you can’t prepare it).

Maybe he was having a bad day, but this was not appreciated, and felt like particularly bad customer service. The flight took off slightly late, but landed early by a good margin. Finally, I am not sure where the responsibility for this lies, but one of our suitcases had been opened, unpacked and then the contents thrown back in in a random manner so that various items were crushed and had minor damage. There was a note placed inside the bag from Avianca that simply stated that the bag had been opened and checked etc, but there were no contact details to complain about the bad and careless re-packing of the suitcase.

Shockingly, Avianca failed to provide even complimentary water, a standard expectation on any flight. The lack of consideration for passengers' well-being was striking, and the overall experience left much to be desired. Adding to the disappointment was Avianca's carry-on baggage policy. Passengers were not permitted to bring any carry-on items unless they paid a hefty fee of US$90, allowing for a mere 8 kgs. This policy felt more like a money-making scheme than a reasonable regulation. All in all, my experience with Avianca was marred by overpricing, a dearth of basic services, and an unjust carry-on policy, making it hard to recommend the airline to others.

The planes are junk, with no legroom at all, no amenities (even some that shouldn't be considered that, like simple water, where if you want some, you'll have to pay 5USD for or be forced to go to the back of the plane to get tap water which if you're a frequent traveler, will understand is alright in paper only). It's dirty, and the seats don't recline (this is not hyperbole, they are physically not built to do so), unless you pay for their ""business economy"" (which is a joke of course). These are 5+ hour flights and they won't even do peanuts or a bottle of water. Their in-flight entertainment has to be through YOUR OWN devices, which I understand is the way all airlines are going, but good luck trying to watch any of their 2 Friends episodes with their bad service and a broken outlet to charge your Ipad.

Well, Avianca will redefine your expectations. Let's embark on a turbulent journey through the skies of disappointment and frustration. First off, the seats. If you're anything taller than an average garden gnome, you might as well prepare to fold yourself into a pretzel. Legroom? What's that? Unless you're part of the elite business class, your legs will have a more meaningful conversation with the seat in front of you than any in-flight entertainment could provide. But the economy plus style seats come to the rescue, promising the luxury of an adjustable headrest and proximity to the entrance. You'll be so close to boarding you'll feel like a part of the cabin crew, yet you'll still yearn for an inch of legroom. Now, let's talk about business class. Oh, the promise of luxury! Imagine my surprise when, on my flight from Bogota to Cancun, I discovered that Avianca's version of business class is ""business  unclass"". No food, no drinks, and to add a cherry on top, the power point for charging devices decided to take a vacation of its own. The flight attendants' indifference was breathtaking, I thought they might have mistaken the cabin for a meditation retreat.  While their tickets come with a price tag that could rival a Michelin-star restaurant bill, the service is more budget buffet than fine dining. And Avianca possesses a unique talent for canceling tickets that were purchased early to save you money. I generously bought tickets for my family. Avianca sent me an email, claiming ""inconsistencies"" and promising a refund. When I checked online, everything was hunky-dory, tickets marked as ""Confirmed."" A call to customer service, was like navigating a maze with no exit. Rounds of pressing buttons and fruitless conversations later, I finally managed to get an answer from a Spanish-speaking agent, who assured me everything was fine, just as the website indicated. But oh, the website! Desperate for clarity, I submitted a support request through Avianca's website, complete with a list of questions and details. What did I receive in return? Silence, punctuated only by the closing of my support request. Undeterred, I called customer service yet again. This time, an agent kindly recreated my support request. I thought, surely, this time I'd receive a response. Wrong again! Days later, déjà vu – the support request was closed, and my questions remained unanswered. Frustrated and with no funds allocated for the ticket purchase, I turned to my bank, who confirmed Avianca hadn't taken a cent. I had to wrestle Avianca for written confirmation that the tickets were indeed canceled and beg for another support request, all while longing for a straightforward answer. In the end, I had to physically visit an Avianca office and buy a more expensive ticket, all thanks to their baffling customer service and ticket-cancellation antics.

Not only do they charge for water and soft drinks, they told us they don't take Canadian visa cards so could not even get that. So no food or drinks on the flight for us. No screens, but they had WiFi streaming. On both flights the USB chargers on the seats did not work. We had portal chargers. Worst was when we got to Bogota to get our connection, we were denied boarding. They overbooked the flight on the connection! We kept asking for information, offering to pay for an upgrade etc and they were so rude and obnoxious it was shocking. Just ""we overbooked, you fly tomorrow"".

Furthermore you have to chase them several times to get it. Their technology is lacking many things cannot be taken care of online and require a call with the inefficient customer service.

We took a flight with stops both ways cause there was no other option by the time we book our vacation to Cartagena with a stop in Bogota. Family of 4, 2 kids. We were very surprised when we realized they charge everything on board even a bottle of water, only tap water is free and you need to be specific, though I wouldn't recommend it. On top of that, no American Express is allowed inside the plane. When we landed in Bogota we had to take the plane stairs and take a bus full of people with doors that were not closing, it was cold, like 56 degrees Fahrenheit. We travel with a stroller, and even after being very specific that we needed it during our stop, they send it straight to the destination there was no way to get it back during the stop. The second flight was delayed by an hour after we were waiting already 20 minutes in the boarding line we returned to the gate, with no explanation given, after the hour they advised us to move immediately to the new gate and we walk in a rush to make us wait another 30 minutes. The outbound flight was the worse of all, my daughter was feeling ill cause of bad digestion and I asked for a wheelchair at check-in so she didn't have to walk in Bogota airport, they couldn't fulfill my request, no apology, they asked me to wait around 15 minutes for someone to come up with the wheelchair and believe me for them 15 minutes is more like half an hour waiting, in my personal experience (for the record we did not have a bad experience during our vacation at the city, on the contrary, everyone was very polite), my daughter had to walk or we were going to lose our flight home. Last but not least they called my name on the loudspeaker and at the counter they told me I was selected for the security verification, I was set aside with another group of people and they did not let me talk to my family after that and they took my passport.  They did not care and were very rude, I was carrying their documents at the time and I they also took it from me when I told them in a very rude way too. I had to make signs to my family through a glass from the distance to hardly explain what happened. They treat me in a very very unprofessional way with no consideration at all.

Avianca re-booked me for a later flight and down grading me from Business to Economy without even informing me. Swiss Air came to my aid and helped me to get back into Business as this was what I had paid several thousand dollars for. Thank you, Swiss Air!

Interestingly, people who were traveling with much larger items were allowed to proceed without purchasing additional luggage (i.e. guitars). During the ticketing process, Avianca employees were forcing passengers with suspected personal items ""too large"" to get out of the ticketing line to measure their items, in an attempt to extort more money (similar to other cheap airlines).

Their employees are rude, unhelpful, and don't care about assisting their customer's. We arrived at the airport 3 hours ahead of our flight and went to their front desk to check in 2.5 hours prior. We were unable to self-check in or pre-check in as their machine/system didn't like my husband's documents so we had to actually speak with someone to check in. 2.5 hours early and they told us they closed down and that they are unable to check us in. We asked what they expected us to do, and they said that it is our fault and that we are out of luck. We were provided their customer service line (which wasn't working for the first few hours even though we constantly called) and we asked for a supervisor and was denied because their supervisor is in a different part of the airport and won't do anything for us. We were told to just call the service line and that they will not help us as they walked away from us. Mind you I am not from this country and was essentially abandoned there which they again said was my fault for not coming even earlier (even though they were only there 3.5 hours ahead so only allowing a 1-hour window to get checked in. When we called, they said that we would have to pay $200 extra per ticket to rebook on a different flight since they can't verify or do anything on their end. We missed our flight and attempted to get the supervisor for the next shift (almost 4 hours later) who was barely able to get us on their next flight only because 2 of the passenger's hadn't checked in an hour prior to the flight- otherwise we were out of luck and would have missed our connecting flight with a different airline. On the phone they said that they have nothing to do with it, that they can't reimburse me later on a supervisor side of things and that they should have been there up to an hour before the flight leaves but they left 2 hours before. Other passengers ended up having to take their checked bags past security only because they were able to check in online. They were ok with me being stranded and stuck there and blamed us even though they say nothing about when the latest you can check in. On top of that you need to make sure you bring a card to purchase water, drinks, or food as they dont allow you to bring any onto the plane. The seats are small, the employees are rude and unhelpful. I would much rather spend more money in order to not have the stress or worry again then to have to have this be even a remote possibility in the future. They were overall horrible and did nothing to really fix the situation. Take my warning and don't take them unless you like being even more stressed when you fly.

It started with getting an email stating our flight is getting rescheduled 5 hours before departure. Our flight had one stop at SAL, and the new rescheduled flight arrived later than the next one departed. The email stated that I need to either confirm a new flight or “easily manage your change”. None of the links worked.  I've tried to reach out to Avianca's customer support to get further instructions and raise concerns about the situation. Calling the number resulted in numerous minutes waiting and listening to a verbatim, and when finally selected to talk to a representative, call hanged up every time. The bot in WhatsApp is useless the same way: neither way to sort out rescheduling issue nor talking to the representative.  In half an hour I've got another rescheduling message stating that instead of a trip with one stop and about 7 hours long trip it transformed into 31+ hour long trip with 2 stops including one overnight. No questions about whether it fits were asked. No ways to sort it out as well.   Considering that there's no real customer support, my wife and I decided to go to airport and maybe find anyone there to shed the light on the situation. In the airport, we've met the whole line of confused people with the same issues we encountered. The lady on the counter even tried to charge us for not being checked-in and selected seats. Luckily, we've managed to convince her that it's all a big mistake. Asked her multiple times about the logistics of our luggage, and we were told to rest assured that we'll just need to pick it up at our final destination. We arrived at San Salvador by night, considering our next flight will be at 8am next day, we were proposed a hotel, transfer, dinner, and breakfast next day. Asked again about our luggage, got the same answer. When we arrived at the hotel the kitchen was closed and by the time we needed to leave (6am) it would be still closed, so food coupons were useless. Huge thanks to the hotel staff who realized how miserable the situation was, made for sandwiches for us and other people who ended up with the same situation.   The next step was New Mexico, which airport doesn't have a real transit zone, so it's required to leave the airport and then reenter it again. We are not US citizens, it was pure luck that we had US and a Schengen visas, so we could leave airports in El Salvador and New Mexico.  When finally arrived at Costa Rica, we realized that our baggage is lost. When filing a claim for Avianca to retrieve it, we were told that we should have taken our luggage in New Mexico, and we'll get it back the next morning. It didn't happen. Support phone line was useless again. WhatsApp's communication helped after a couple of hours of trying to reach out to them. Luggage should have been returned the next morning at 6am, and it was but to another hotel. Eventually, we've managed to get our luggage back. And after inspection of it, understood that it was looted. The only advice WhatsApp contact provided was to go to avianca.com, that has multiple times proved its uselessness. As a result, we've lost 2 days of our booked property without any compensation, ruined the beginning of our vacation by depriving sleep, lacking basic things that were in our luggage and ultimately looted raincoat from our luggage, that we really needed in our journey.",3,0,0,Not specified,Avianca

I ended up taking out money from the ATM and paying the airline crew members directly to board the last flight of the night.

Our first flight out we showed up over 3 hours early to the terminal. The boarding crew announced that everyone needed to get in line and print out their boarding passes, no electronic passes would be allowed on the plane (suspicious already). When we got to the front of the hour long line, the boarding attendant asked us for our Peruvian COVID affidavit (something that can be filled out at your destination). When we said we didn't fill it out yet, they told us we would not be able to board the flight, as the affidavit needed to be filled out >48 hours before any flight (if you check the embassy requirements it needs to be LESS than 48 hours beforehand, obviously since its basically a symptom survey). We showed them the embassy page and they refused to believe us and pretended not to understand. The whole time they were having a side conversation in Spanish talking about how the plane was overbooked. Us gringos must've looked like an easy target, but unfortunately we were all fluent in Spanish. They sent us running all around pretending to help us until the flight took off (yes, 2 hours of sending us on errands), then told us we were out of luck. At this point we got angry and called them out on blatantly screwing us since they overbooked their flight. They originally tried to simply kick us off the plane and out the door, but we managed to make them book us another flight the next day (>48 hours beforehand, huh??). We missed a full day of our trip and wasted hundreds of dollars on missed hotel, ubers, not to mention the hours wasted in the airport. On the return trip, they cancelled two of our 'seats'. They said we had tickets, but no 'seats'. They tried to kick us off the return flight too, and made one of us get an onsite COVID test, even though this person had gotten and recovered from COVID as per the US embassy requirements. Even after getting their COVID test done on site, they were told they had no 'seat' and would have to shell out hundreds of dollars for first class if they wanted to board the flight. This friend had to resort to crying to manipulate the shady Avianca agents into letting her sit in her assigned, purchased seat.  I spent hours on customer care the night before, each time getting to an automated line in the end that would 'call back in an hour', then the callback would be silent, tell me it couldn't understand me, and say 'try again in an hour'. Some sort of time-wasting bot to avoid having actual customer service. I tried both the Spanish and English Customer service lines. Luckily, I didn't 'need' to get a COVID test, but they did harass me and request tons of random personal information at their desk as well as ask me for multiple unnecessary affidavits (which I filled out this time, expecting a repeat of their antics) before reluctantly giving me a boarding pass.  In the terminal for our return flight, I tried to request assistance in unloading since our layover was very short, and the boarding assistant tried to CANCEL my flight, since i 'seemed worried about the layover'. Then she wouldn't hand my ticket back until I had re-proved I had my affidavits and COVID test etc. They also came around the terminal and checked a ton of people's bags due to limited cabin space (not completely unusual, but added to the stress especially given our layover).

To top everything off I compared how much my friend paid for his checked luggage at the counter that was 50lbs and told me $19.33 while I paid around $22 for a small 10kg bag. After finding this out I went to talk to a supervisor and told me there was nothing he could do. By far Avianca is the worst airline I have flown with.

Avianca has been the worst experience I've ever had. I booked through Expedia and was automatically given an XS fare due to it being the only fare available. I've never flown this airline before, and had no idea about how the fares worked. I figured I could pay extra to upgrade my fare eventually like any other airline I've flown. Several weeks on the phone with Avianca customer support, and almost every agent I spoke to did not speak English at all, or well. I was unable to get any help from their support team. Emails never received a response. Due to the 24 hour window for refund expiring, I was locked in and had no choice but to take this flight. $1082 total for 2 tickets, on a 1 hour and 30 minutes flight, which did not include checked bags. I paid $70 online for the discounted checked luggage, and upon arrival at the airport was told I could not board unless I paid the full price of $161 for our checked bags. I explained that I paid already, and showed the transaction in my bank. They refused to listen, so I had to pay the extra $161 in order to board. The supervisor gave me a receipt and told me to get a refund once we landed. Once we landed we did as instructed, but we were told that they do not give refunds. After speaking to another supervisor she said I needed to get the refund through my bank. We came to colombia due to a K1 Visa. The embassy took long to process the visa and we could not reschedule the flight due to the XS fare. The $500+ ticket was wasted, and to make matters worse, I purchased the $70 bags online for this flight. $500+$161+70 thrown away for no good reason at all. I chose to fly back with Wingo which provides flight flexibility for $21, and includes checked bags for a similar price.  This has got to be one of the most corrupt airlines in the world!

The irony is, an Avianca agent booked this for me with my credit card and at no point did they mention any of this - to add insult to injury, I had to pay another $15 usd to print out my boarding pass when their website was not allowing me to process my online checkin. I showed the agent on how I was able to fill out all the online information to process my web checkin but when it got to the last page, the screen just hung and froze. She just shrugged her shoulders and said that I have to pay $165 usd. Either I take my chances and keep trying or I pay the fee to board the flight. At the gate, the agent said that I was on an S category ticket and had to pay for my carry on. I showed him that I was booked on M and he made me search for validation and ended up saying that I could not board without paying an additional $100 usd for my luggage.

A few weeks later I had a great job opportunity that was preventing me to go on the trip, I called Avianca support and I was told that the ticket was non-refundable and that no changes could be made. They also gave me the option to do a form online but that it would be of no use. However, I made the request form and submitted. The representative told me that I was going to get a response in the following days, a few days went by and I had no response. so I had to call once again to see what was the status on the request. I was told one more time that there was nothing they could do and that I had to take that flight, so I decided to cancel my business plans and go on the trip. On the day of the flight, when I got to the airport I went to do my check in and was told that my ticket was refunded and that I was unable to flight.  I called Avianca support once again, and the representative told me that my booking was still valid and that there was no issue with the ticket, so I decided to go over to the front of the cashier at the airport and passed the phone over to the employee that was doing checkins, she told me that my ticket was in fact refunded and that’s when the person on the phone realized that my ticket was not in the system. I proceed to ask the representative about the refund and he stated that it was deposit on my account on June 8th, so I went and checked my transactions to make things worst , I was only refunded the amount for the taxes. So, out of a $386.57 ticket I received only $127, with no confirmation of my refund, never even received any emails with the prove or receipt. At the airport all I could do was ask for help, but to no surprise I got no concrete response on how I could solve my issue. I had to go online my self and pray that there was still a ticket available on that flight. Ironically enough, there was just 1 more ticket available.. probably the same one that was “refunded”. I had to spend $429.80 for a one way trip from Miami to Medellin.

So I called customer services several times in one day because the call would always drop. After the 3rd attempt, they were able to find only the baggage that were purchased for my husband but not mine. They did an internal investigation and concluded it was never found.

Their website will not allow you to check in online and cause you to ask the ticket counter to print a boarding pass and charge you $15usd to print, they will stop you before you get on the gate while other passengers are waiting in line to board the plane holding you hostage and demanding that your fare does not include carry on luggage. We had to show them validation of payment before they were able to release us. When they change your flight itinerary and you can no longer travel due to the flight change, they will not give you a refund or offer an alternative because their call centre agents don’t pick up the phone. After waiting three hours to speak to an agent, they’d either hang up or transfer you to another agent that can speak English where you’d have to wait another three hours to get an agent.

However, immigration line extremely long and painfully slow at 7 am. There was no airport employee to be found and I ended up cutting the line myself because I knew I was going to cut it very close to my 7:50 am flight. I ran to my gate to find out they plane had already departed (30 mins before departure time) and there were a dozen other passengers who were in my exact same shoes. After running around the airport for an hour trying to speak to someone, they finally directed us back out to the counter where they had told us the next flight out was the following day, exact time. They gave us hotel, lunch, & dinner. Okay, no biggie it was Saturday I was very frustrated but at least it was accommodated. Waited 3 hours at the hotel to finally be ready and crashed. The following day I get up nice and early and board my plane and flew home to D.C to find my checked bag never made it. Looked like I wasn't the only one with the issue because there were 3 other individuals barking at the employee at the same time. They said IF they find it they would ship it to my address (3 hours away). 5 days later I get a suitcase that does not belong to me. It does not describe anything that was handwritten on the report (color, size, locks, etc.) and it even had another name on the handle tag. I am beyond myself at this point that my luggage is still lost and they sent me what is not mine. Honestly, this as been the worst customer service/flying experience of my life. I will never fly with Avianca again. When you call, you get transferred 10 times no one answers your question. They make you file claims online that most likely will never get resolved.

I understand you can put things in writing where people purchasing economy airfare relinquish their ability to reschedule their flight without fees, but you’d think that a $422 one-way 6-hour flight pre-purchased 1.5 months ahead of time, made by someone who’s flown with you before, who has had a family emergency where their father had a heart attack and is undergoing life-saving surgery, you would morally think charging them $962 dollars in penalties to reschedule their flight to same day is a little heartless and unethical, when there were open economy seats available on 3 flights leaving that same day. But no, I have to pay almost $1,000 in fees and penalties to upgrade myself to first class just to be able to change my flight since you treat S and XS ticket holders like trash. Icing on the cake is that you can clearly see on Google flights that it would only cost $600 for a one-way ticket if I’d wait 2 days to fly out. Their website is not user friendly, the customer hotline was very unhelpful, and I was told the supervisor didn’t have time to talk to me or there wasn't one available. My experience was similar when talking to the customer service department at the Managua Airport in Nicaragua and that a manager was unavailable. I was obviously pretty stressed and as a non-native Spanish speaker it was difficult to try and explain my situation in Spanish, but even when a bilingual American tried to help me they still weren’t willing to budge. Lastly their staff seems to be completely incompetent telling me I need to pay them $1200, when I can clearly do it online and get a result of $962 (still ridiculous).

We booked our tickets directly with Avianca over the phone with a voucher that we had from a trip that was cancelled due to the pandemic. Without making it clear over the phone or notifying us, they made our return flight from Bogota to Washington Dulles airport and had us go 1 hour away to Washington Reagan airport to connect to our flight back home to Chicago O’Hare. We had to run all the way to get to customs in time - did I mention I’m disabled? Then, we had to take a $50 Lyft all the way to Reagan airport, I’m writing this review in the Lyft as we speak. After being given the run-around by United (who our connecting flight is with) & Avianca ticketing agents at the counters, we only have 1.5 hours to make it to Reagan, check-in &, drop off our luggage, make it through security, and get to our gate.

I used to enjoy flying Avianca compared to any American airline.  Sadly this airline started going downhill in 2019 when they announced they were bankrupt, the service started to get reduced but was still good compared to what they offer today. After covid, this airline has taken the low cost approach. What they pass as ""business"" class is a complete joke. The same food they give to economy is the same meal they give to business. They no longer give you alcohol at all, nothing during the boarding process either. No blankets, pillows or kit. All of that is gone. You have to ask the FAs for any other drink which is boxed juice or coffee, some cans of coca cola or small bottles of water. The Flight Attendants were still nice like they always have been but they are noticeably not as visible as they used to. Not once did they check up on me during the flight like the used to, the lead FA did not introduce themselves to us either. Before covid they would greet us by name and ask if we wanted anything to drink or anything else. It looks like they are getting rid of business class altogether soon so I guess they don't care about business class customers at this point. It looks like they returned all their newer planes and only kept the older TACA fleet probably since they have already been paid off at this point. The first leg of my trip was on a newer A319 from 2014. But I got stuck with the same old A320 on the rest of my legs and this plane was from 2004. On one of the flights, the FA made an announcement that due to covid they were not going to have any in flight service so no movie being played on the overhead screens on this older plane allegedly because of covid. Seems like Avianca is using covid as an easy scapegoat for reducing any type of service and reducing costs. At the end of the day, I'm not a fan of the low cost approach. They are providing low cost service and product yet the airfares are not low cost fares. I paid more for my flight now than I did precovid. If they're going to switch to low cost it should also reflect on the airfare cost as well not just in the product they are offering. I don't understand how this supposed low cost airline is still part of Star Alliance. I'm sure they're going to get kicked out once they get rid of business class altogether. This airline went from a Skytrax award winning airline to a disgrace in a span of 3 years. If you flew this airline precovid and haven't flown it since then, please prepare yourself since it is not the same airline. If you can, fly a different airline that does not charge you legacy airline prices for a low cost product. One of the few positive things I can say about Avianca is that all my flights were on time or arrived earlier than originally estimated even despite leaving late from SAL It doesn't look like they are having any of the issues the american airlines are having with flights getting cancelled, labor shortages etc.",1,1,1,A319,Avianca

788899,2022-06-24,Jesus Vasquez Tabares,True,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Medellin via Bogota,June 2022,4,2,1,1,no,I do NOT recommend,"London to Medellin via Bogota. It is sad to write this review since Avianca was my favorite airline, but many things have changed and not necessarily for the better. It should be noted that on the B787 aircraft, the seats in both, business and economy class are still very comfortable and on a par with other star alliance member airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Turkish, United, etc. The big difference is in the service and food on board. On this particular flight, the offer for business class was two kinds of pasta served on a plastic container, a sandwich for starters and an ice cream for dessert. When I asked the crew if there was any other option, with obvious embarrassment she told me that it was the only option since this was a temporary menu due to Covid. Curiously, other airlines have resumed and even improved their menu on board, which clearly indicates that this is just an excuse to cut costs. The airline has also introduced new fares (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL) The only fare that still includes 2 pieces of baggage in business is XXL, which is the same as a full fare business. Back in 2019 you were able to check in 2 bags in both, business and economy (32kg each in business and 23kg in economy) Sadly now is all gone. Most tickets are Size S which means you still pay what you used to pay back in 2019 if not more, but if you want to check in even just one bag you are looking at least £100GBP. The frequent flyer program Life miles has also changed for the worst, Accrual was previously based on distance, now it is based of the price paid for the ticket, excluding any taxes. In this occasion I've earned a total of 920 miles for the LHR-BOG sector. If you consider that the fare often exceeds the £1300GBP for one way and that you need 11.500 to reach Silver, 80% of which must be flown with Avianca, it is almost impossible to achieve elite status and perhaps also the most difficult program to achieve status in any airline member of star alliance. The inflight entertainment has been reduced to just a few old movies, no music, no games. Apart from the 787 and a couple A330, all IFE screens are being gradually removed. The only saving grace is being the only airline to fly directly between the UK and Colombia, but apart from that there isn't much to look forward to. Sadly, I do NOT recommend Avianca, better service, baggage allowance, on board food, and reasonable prices to reach Colombia can be found by just having and extra stop in Madrid (Iberia, Air Europa), Frankfurt (Lufthansa), Paris (Air France), Amsterdam (KLM), and even in Istanbul with Turkish Airlines.",1,1,1,Boeing 787-8,Avianca

Had to be in person. The only airline available was/is Avianca, with whom I've never flown, as I haven't had the opportunity to go to South America to this point. I read reviews and watched one or two videos that showed a pretty ordinary but fairly typical business class experience in terms of food and drink. I took note of the 1990 - 2000-era business class seats and figured I could pretend it was still 2003 just this once. The flight out of YYZ to Bogota left after midnight Toronto time and they served a little box lunch with a small sandwich, a bag of plantain crisps, and a tiny Hostess-like chocolate cup cake. No wine, only a small bottle of water. I figured, OK, everyone just wants to sleep so nothing fancy is fine. we arrived in Bogota at 5am or so for a very long (9 hours) layover and, although I paid for a C-class ticket, the 2.00pm flight to Curacao was all economy, loaded from the tarmac after we all crammed into busses from the airport basement for the ride to the plane. Fast forward to yesterday's flight. This time there was business class out of Curacao but still had the crammed bus ride back to the basement at BOG. I went to the lounge where I'd spent some 9 hours on the way in, grabbed a glass of wine, and noticed that at 2.07pm, the 2.50pm flight to TTZ showed, ""closed"". Panicking, I ran to the plane and sat down. No, it wasn't closed, and we waited a good 40 minutes after I sat down before buttoning up. I was tired, frustrated, and really annoyed at this point. Now the fun part. This is a 6.5 hour flight. It starts after lunch and goes over dinner so I figured we'd have a nice 2003-era business class dinner with a glass of wine. Oh boy - did we ever not have that. Once again, the same pathetic little box lunch, this time with a tiny cheese sandwich, the requisite plantain chips and cupcake, and tiny bottle of water. The only time I ever saw a flight attendant after that (other than landing) was the one time I went to the washroom and, while standing right in front of the seated flight attendants, asked for more water. I cannot believe that I paid for C- and J-class tickets so I could ride in dilapidated blue leather seats with no footrest, and then be treated to the ""service"" provided by the indifferent and disregarding flight attendants and their poor box lunches.

Yesterday February 19th, 2021 I got at least 14 emails from Avianca letting me know that my trip from March 5th were changed, and after I was aware of those emails, I called the airline and after 1 hour and 12 minutes of waiting in the Avianca customer service line, I was attended for a nicer Avianca's representative, but the options she gave me wasn't accepted for me, neither by my family. Avianca pretended that I arrived at San Salvador at 6:20 pm by March 5th and take our connexon to Guatemala next day at 8:15 AM and no paying us the night that we are forced to stay in San Salvador. I never been in San Salvador before, and I know nobody there, so the option of staying 14 hours in the airport was unacceptable. I requested to speak with a supervisor, and this guy took 20 minutes before passing to the phone, and instead of showing me compassion and kindness, the first word he spelled out from his mouth was telling me that customers think that asking for a supervisor will resolve all their problems. In fact, it is not a good beginning of a conversation with a customer that has been in the phone 1 hour and 32 minutes. Avianca needs to give training to their supervisors and make of those guys gentle and caring for its customers. In conclusion after my long call from yesterday late at night I resolved nothing and the solution from the supervisor was repeat what the representative have told me or request a refund from Avianca with not horizon when I will be getting back my money.

We arrived 4 hrs prior to the flight, had submitted all pertinent COVID documents via their requested email address. We had hard copy and email/pdf proof of proper CV testing negative. My wife and 12 others were pushed aside saying we were not on some “list” to enter Nicaragua. When asked when would their list be updated, “maybe tomorrow” was their answer. As the takeoff time neared, it was evident they weren’t going to even try to call someone to confirm our (and an elderly couple from Missouri + 8 others) documents were valid and factual. The “manager” would walk up to our group then disappear as is on the phone. Finally I approached the ticket counter and tried to get a refund after the last call for boarding passengers was made. The response was “you have to do it online”. Well when I looked online at the Avianca app, they had bumped our reservation off (as well as everyone else in the group of 12) not a hint that we had an arranged flight via our e-tix. I showed them that there was no record online and they told us to call a number that we had been trying to call previously to get to the root of the issue. One ticketed passenger had been on hold for over 1 hour 15 minutes, they would not issue me proof that I was there at the ticket counter, so I took a picture of our group as proof should they say we did not show up for the flight. As an American citizen, I should say all email responses from them were in Spanish. So if you happen to not speak a foreign language, you will need a translator to decipher. You’ll also be treated as a second class citizen in Miami airport. I stood very patiently trying to speak with either of the two line representatives, only to be overlooked by those speaking to her in Spanish. We drove the hour home, and promptly called the credit card company to get our money back. Thanks only to Chase credit card for getting this resolved.

A random lady in the airport kindly offered to help me because I was in tears. She called the number for me. Took me 7 hours to get my flight changed. They told me I could go via a different country.

Great flight, staff, service, food and beverages. Fast forward 10 years later. I have flown with them many times to my wife's birthplace of Colombia and the drop all aspects in just a single decade is unfathomable. Food is bland and the staff are mostly indifferent. The kicker for me this time was after my flights. I was stuck for 24 hours due to civil unrest in Quito. I just wanted to get out. United, one of their partners, was not coming to get me and other ticketed passengers. I bit the bullet and bought a ticket that would get at least to Bogota Colombia so that I could then get back to the States and decided to fly to Miami since that was the cheapest flight at the last minute. I bought the ticket. Went to check in. The Avianca check in agent for the flight asked why I had two flights with them-turns out that while I was buying a ticket directly with them at the Quito airport at their counter, United had rebooked me with Avianca for later on that day since they were partners. The agent looked into it and stated I should keep this flight because they knew it was going out-the plane and staff were there whereas the later flight was still a risky one to depend on-it could get canceled. I took it to Bogota and once there United was able to get me back to Houston. Thus, there was absolutely no reason to fly to Miami so I just didn't take that flight. Shortly thereafter, I contacted Avianca about a refund for the flight I didn't take in this unusual situation. Surprisingly, within a week they got back with me and gave me about a $35 refund!  The flight I didn't take was at least a $400-$500 flight. I called back. I was given the run around for months. At no point, could Avianca provide any sort of cost breakdown as to why I was getting at least less than 10% of the value of the flight back-AND I had been an Avianca miles member for a decade! I called in at least 6 times and no one could ever answer my question-I mean how did I even get that tiny refund? Frankly, they used their English language barrier to continue to give me the run around for months-until I finally gave up. Well, all that means is that I will never fly Avianca again.

The supervisor was conveniently in a meeting during most of this. When several people asked for a refund, they were told that it would not be possible. When we asked if there was any way they could help us by allowing us to fly on another flight or asking another airline for assistance, they said there was nothing they could do. We were given coupons for a free meal while we waited to a small cafe, which ran out of food quickly and ended up resorting to bread with a slice of meat. When I was finally home, I filed 2 complaints because the first time the person on the phone didn't file it correctly. They are willing to give me $22 in credit or some miles with them.

Their business class is nothing more than the first 3 rows of seats being separated by a curtain from the coach class with exactly the same seat 3x3. No In-flight entertainment, no WI-FI, no reading material besides the safety card and I believe, in the longest flight this airline has within Colombia (1:40 min +taxi ), one cup of coffee or soda (not even the whole can) was offered. At my request of another drink or food even to buy, the flight attendant ""politely"" denied my request and simply told us nothing was available. I wonder why my wife and I along with one more passenger were the only ones on that ""exclusive"" side of the plane. They definitely got us and looking at the extremely low quantity of people flying on that cabin, it looks that already other people learned their lesson and sprayed the word among others not to pay that step up in price for absolutely nothing in return.

I have flown Avianca many times and have noticed a decline in the quality of their services. I usually travel business class from SFO-SAL-SFO - the last time on August 11 of this year. On the SFO/SAL leg of my trip I took AV 565 (an early morning flight) in business class and, while the crew was attentive and the seat relatively comfortable, the food was atrocious. We had no choice of meal as they ran out of a second option (there were only 12 business class passengers) and wound up eating some sort of a omelette burrito stuffed with bacon which was just inedible. I have had better meals in Economy. Once we landed, my bags took for ever to be delivered at the carousel even though they had the ""priority"" tag (I saw plenty of other bags from the same flight without the priority tags before mine turned up). On the SAL/SFO leg of my trip (AV 560), the plane - an A320- had old recliner seats (the sort one sees in domestic first class for 1 hour trips). The entertainment selection lacked personalized screens AND the music channels were not operational - this was a long 5 and half hours flight, so the combination of a relatively old and uncomfortable seat, paucity of choice for movies and no music at all made it for a particularly boring time. I might add that the food offering was also mediocre: we were offered some nuts with a drink prior to the meal (not warmed up, either) which consisted of a choice of chicken, beef or vegetarian selection. Thie beef was tough and flavorless (no matter how much salt and pepper I poured on it) and was followed by a mediocre mousse-like dessert. Again, the experience was salvaged by the attentive and nice flight attendant which, on both legs, were the only positive aspects of the experience aboard Avianca. i would not recommend that anyone spend the 60,000 miles required for a round trip from SF0/SAL on Avianca. One barely gets the sort of service expected during a short domestic hop; old seats lacking the bells and whistles of modern business class, horrible food and indifferent luggage handling for priority tagged bags.

Avianca ruined the first and last day of my holiday. My husband and I were flying from Lima to Cusco direct.

When we arrived there however, they told us there were no seats for us as the flight was overbooked. The service was horrible, no excuses, nothing, just you can’t fly. We were booked on a flight much later in the day with a stop in Lima, so we arrived 10 hours later than planned in Cusco. All we got was a 60USD voucher to use in a next Avianca flight! Coming back we flew direct from Lima to Bogota in the afternoon. I checked in online and thought that for sure, everything would go smoothly this time. How wrong I was. The night before our flight we went out with friends for cocktails, when we arrived back in the hotel I had an e-mail from avianca, send just before 1am to tell me there were changes to my booking. Apparently we now had to fly at 11am, 6 hours earlier than we were supposed to. We tried contacting call centers, but nobody answered. Just a computer who told us that the afternoon flight was still confirmed. When I checked our booking however, we were checked in for the early flight! Nobody asked us if this was convenient, if we could even make it. As my husband needed to really be back for work the following day, we took the early flight as we couldn’t risk not flying at all that day. We had however very little sleep and no chance to say goodbye to my brother, who lives in Lima and who I hadn’t seen in over 6 months. At the airport again no excuses or explanation whatsoever. The flight left with almost 2 hours delay. I will not fly with aviance again, I will prefer to pay more, or even prefer a layover, at least I will not have to be stressed in advance and be able to get on the flight I pay for!

I booked my flights home through Avianca specifically because I needed to reach home to spend the last part of the July 4 holiday celebration with my family in California. I could have taken shorter routes, but this got me there at 8 pm today, July 4. During the night prior Avianca sent a note that my flights had been changed and now I come home the morning of July 5. I went to the airport and asked for help. The woman behind the counter left me standing. I am in the business class line and have business class tickets. She did not listen and she did not help me. I finally went to the gate and tried there, but the same woman moved there. She said at the counter that there were no other flights. At the gate she instead said that she cannot make changes from Santiago. All changes had to happen when I reached Bogota. Then in Bogota the agent said there is nothing he can do. I asked to even go to a different airport or whatever would work. I was in Bogota all day. I then asked for lounge access because the Internet wasn’t working. Instead he handed me a coupon for a Burger King hamburger meal and sent me on. I missed my holiday and family, and I had a horrible experience. I was exhausted and on the floor at the airport trying to charge my phone so I could contact my family. Even if I could not be helped, I could have been treated kindly. I was crying when I left the agent. I will advise others at work and home to avoid Avianca in the future based on how I was treated. The final straw is that I could not even file a complaint because their complaint system would never accept the complaint and kept cycling or advising that there were invalid characters.

The night before, I got an email requesting to check in with their “web check-in”, so I did. After the web check-in, Avianca sent an email with my boarding pass stating “If you only have carry-on luggage, please go directly to the boarding gate.” I only had carry on luggage, so I went directly to Terminal 3 as my boarding pass stated. After passing extensive security at Terminal 3, I looked for Avianca booths or staff but I couldn’t find any. After asking around, airport staff directed me on a shuttle bus to Terminal 2. Once I got to Terminal 2, airport staff redirected me to Terminal B. Once I got to Terminal B, airport staff said my boarding gate had not been assigned yet because it wasn’t on the monitor yet, but it would be departing from one of the gates in the same room we were in and my flight should be on one of the monitors in that section in a couple hours as it got closer to the departure time. I was in the departure area where I was told it would depart from 38 minutes before it was scheduled to depart and 51 minutes before it did depart but there weren’t any planes departing to BOG and my flight wasn’t anywhere on the monitor it was supposed to be. Airport staff didn’t see it on the monitor either. I went to two other airport staff and one of them looked up my flight with an app on his phone. Terminal 3 was listed as the departure gate so he told me I needed to go there. I took the shuttle bus back to Terminal 3, but there weren’t any Avianca booths or staff so I went over to an Alaska Airlines booth. The lady tried to help me but wasn’t able to see any Avianca departing gate info from her computer. She told me to go to the Avianca front desk outside of Terminal 3 security checkpoint. By the time I got to the Avianca front desk it was too late to get through security fast enough to make my flight. The Avianca supervisor told me there was a flight to BOG 26 hours later but that she couldn’t wave the rescheduling fee but that customer service may be able to. There shouldn’t have been a charge since I did everything I was instructed to do by Avianca, but she told me I should have checked in at the Avianca front desk before going through the security checkpoint at Terminal 3. I showed her my email from Avianca with my boarding pass instructing me to “go directly to the boarding gate” but she had no response. The supervisor then connected me to customer service to discuss possibly waiving the rescheduling fee. After talking with customer service and being on hold several times, totaling about 2 hours, they provided no alternative besides paying around $1,300 for the next day flight change. I decided not to pay an extra $1,300 to an airline for their mistakes and bought a $400 ticket back home to Seattle with a different airline. I Should have never been provided the web check-in option and told to bypass the Avianca front desk if Avianca provides no reliable way to find the correct departure gate. The flight AV89 should have been displayed on the monitors in Terminal B with all of the other flights. Avianca’s incompetence cost me about $1,600 total and tons of wasted time. I tried to resolve this through Avianca’s dispute resolution process, but they made me jump through endless hoops, accidentally closing my case many times.

That's what the ground staff told me in stern voice. Since most staff were spending time yelling at passengers, that's why the service was very slow. Such a low service standard in my opinion. Cabin crew provided similar level of service - poor. I was sitting at emergency exit row, but the cabin crew failed to inform me of safety procedure. Their mindset around safety were questionable.

FAs were attentive and both legs were early/on time.

Both the ladies standing checking the boarding tickets refused to acknowledge me saying “excuse me” (trying to get their attention) and kept on talking instead.

643447,2019-03-04,K Patapong,True,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lima to Cusco,February 2019,4,4,4,4,yes,attendants seemed friendly,"Lima to Cusco. I was happy to see that the tour agency that booked all my tickets booked me on Avianca, as they were a star alliance member. This meant I could use my Royal Orchid Plus Gold privileges. Our whole itinerary was from Buenos Aires all the way to New York City, making stops along the way. One thing that made me wonder straight from check in was the matter of people trying to cut queues by going to the Business class line. I went up showing my gold bag tag (I had lost my wallet hence my gold card) and the guy still asked for my name. This happened at two of the three airports I had to check in at. Star Alliance lounge in Buenos Aires is crowded not because of lack of capacity, but because too many priority pass users were getting in. When I went there they had stopped admitting priority pass but thankfully my star gold status was enough to admit me plus my mum. Due to the amount of people, I could not connect to the lounge wifi. That is quite a bummer for any lounge. Boarding was organised from A to F, with star gold getting group B. I actually liked this more than boarding with business class passengers as you can board in a more orderly fashion. I settled in seat 7K, but as two rows behind us were empty, i opted to sit by myself and give my mum an empty seat next to her for more comfort. The seat is similar to Thai airways in two aspects; it had massive legroom and a footrest. Something much appreciated on a long flight. After takeoff, service didn’t commence until halfway through the flight, and the flight attendants explained this was due to the turbulent weather while flying over the Andes. At least I ate in the lounge. A paper box served on a flimsy tray with a yoghurt, and inside the box was a potato cake which seemed to be too salty. Food on Avianca seemed to be of okay quality, not comparable to Thai airways or ANA, all of which are in the same alliance. The paper box makes the food look cheap but for environmental quality it seemed okay. We had to go to re check our bags in Lima for our flight to Cusco, and that flight was uneventful. For our flight from Cusco to New York via Bogotá, I asked for an upgrade at check in. This was met with a very quick yes. Unfortunately there was no lounge either in Lima or Cusco. Lima is a hub airport so why is there no lounge!? The boarding pass still showed I was in economy, but at the gate they said “you were already upgraded at checkin, here are your new seat numbers.” This was an older business class and I found that the seat was merely just wider and had better service. The food was still so-so but I finished as I was hungry. Apparently for our overnight in Bogotá, we found out our luggage didn’t make it to Bogotá, due to weight constraints. They arrived four hours later after being rerouted. Re-checking the bags in Bogotá, I was put first on the standby upgrade list. I wasn’t upgraded as all business class passengers checked in. The Avianca lounge left a lot to be desired. The Star Alliance Lounge finder with my filters put on indicated I could use the diamond lounge, but I was denied access and directed to the gold lounge. I was wondering why the New York flight is frequently delayed upwards of an hour, and I found out that they do strip searches at the gate. But this was to select passengers and they delay the entire flight. This was more or less the same story, and flight attendants seemed friendly. Given the choice of alliance, I wouldn’t mind flying Avianca again that much.",2,4,0,"A330-200, A320",Avianca

I write this on the return leg of my (almost) monthly JFK - MDE - BOG commute. I have avoided AV for the longest time but now that their nonstop from New York to Medellin is a daily frequency, it's the easiest connection. The convenience just about outweighs the indignities of the AV experience, though one wonders why this airline is so consistently unpleasant. The unreliability of their operations is of course well known, not just because of the temperamental Colombian climate (which finally might be addressed with better navigation equipment) but also because of notorious ramp delays. A combination of both delayed my MDE to BOG flight, endangering my connection to JFK. At the last minute, a stony faced attendant in the lounge moved me to an earlier flight. Both international flights ran on time, which is either an improvement or an exception. Their A330s now have pretty comfortable lie flat seats. The in flight service is minimal. While the meal quality has improved from inedible to edible in an emergency, the wines remain bottom shelf supermarket. And their practice of blaring advertising into the cabin from boarding till take off is one of the most head ache making, customer unfriendly practices I have encountered in 40 years of flying. Another bizarre practice is their habit not to announce in the lounge when flights board (particularly inconvenient because their boarding times are always moving targets). Ostensibly, that's to avoid noise pollution. Instead, they announce every five minutes that they are not making announcements. Same pollution, just without informational value added.

I chose a chicken roll with vegetables for lunch, it was bland and the vegetables were just scattered on the plate. Essentially a poor economy meal served on china. It came with a miserable selection of cheeses in small portions with one meager piece of guava paste. Dessert was something called ""Tiramisu"", nothing like any tiramisu I have ever eaten before. Prior to landing we were served a chicken sandwich which had fused to the dish, if I received something like this at McDonald's, I would refuse it. Once we landed in LAX we engaged in a wheelchair charade that would have been comical if it not been so frustrating. There were 17 wheelchairs at the deplaning area and only four persons to push them. It was a Laurel and Hardy scenario as we see-sawed our way slowly to the Custom's area. Yes, they were not busy on a Saturday evening but it took us an hour to reach them! By the time we were through, the baggage belt had been emptied and all the ambulatory passengers were long gone.

I was very positively impressed when I flew Avianca for Easter week. After reflecting back on this fantastic trip I noticed how badly used we were to traditional American and European carriers for the following reasons. First of all we were greeted at the airport by some extremely friendly staff members; who personally guided us to the check in zone. After a short queue at the check in zone, I was guided to the exclusive dock inside the terminal where only Avianca flights operate. This made the terminal a lot less crowded than the other dock where Latam, VivaColombia, Wingo and all the other carriers operate. The boarding process was fast and efficient and the flight departed 10 minutes before schedule and the cabin crew members were extremely polite; to the point that upon boarding the airplane I was personally greeted with my name (“good morning and welcome aboard Mr Castro” said the flight attendant). The plane was very clean and although it was one of the old members of Avianca’s fleet (built in 2011), it was as comfortable as all the other members of Avianca's fleet. To my surprise despite the flight being around 50 minutes long it had generous legroom a (I was not on a bulkhead or Exit rows), a huge seat, a personal IFE on every seat and we were given fresh fruit and a croissant on this short early morning flight. The fact that we had an inflight meal on a 50 minute flight is amazing to me as all American carriers I flew (except Delta and JetBlue) don’t even give inflight free meals on international flights that are 3 hours long. Upon arrival at Cartagena everything was as efficient as at El Dorado. My bags were some of the last ones off the plane and it only took me 10 minutes from the moment I walked off the airplane to the moment I walked off the airport doors. Overall it was a fantastic experience, I can’t wait for my next leg of the trip (back to Bogota and then to London Heathrow) to come and if you are flying to Colombia or anywhere in South America it definitely is the airline that you have to fly.",5,4,0,A320,Avianca

Long haul flights London to Bogota on a Boeing 787 with OK service/food. Legroom for a 1,93m/6ft4in like me is an issue so that's why I booked seat with extra legroom. What needs to be improved urgently is the customer service, over chat or phone. The agents have an issue with English and as a result it takes long to communicate. Furthermore seat booking MUST be made available online, not only over the phone.

Our usual route of travel is from New York (JFK) to Santa Marta Colombia (SMR). With a stop in Bogota. Avianca used a third party company for our flight from NYC to Bogota and it was awful (“Wamos”, was the name of the partner airline). The airplane was very old, dirty, and no entertainment system. Also the flight attendant gave us a menu with 3 choices of food, when it was time to order our food, we were told the only choice was breakfast burritos. We were amoung the first people served. Having a menu was useless. The seats were not comfortable at all. We were not able to rest. Those combinations made for a very uncomfortable, long and boring flight. Coming back home was even worse. Again Avianca used the same company to bring us back. Needless to say, it was an old airplane, poor seats, no entertainment system, and low quality food once again. The food was worse this time. We could not eat it. So we traveled uncomfortable, bored, and hungry. I understand Avianca is having some issues with their pilots and are using different ways to transport their clients. There has to be a better solution. We the customer should not have to suffer thru low quality service for the same price. Avianca should respect their clients and partner with a better company to provide the same quality service. You should not charge for a premium service when you are not delivering (what we pay for) premium service. We traveled business class for a reason. We wanted to be comfortable and rested.

We booked two business class tickets for a direct fight to Cartagena that was supposed to land at noon, so we can make our boat connection to Rosario Islands. A week before our trip, we got a notice from Avianca that due to the strike, they had to reroute us through Medellin. The new flight with the layover would bring us to Cartagena at 4:30 PM which meant we would miss our boat connection. I went to the NYC office to cancel those flights and had to book a new flight with Jet Blue last minute. The agent who filled out all the cancellation forms told us it will take 6-8 weeks of the refund. At 6 weeks I called the headquarters to see what is the status of the refund. They told me to have patience and it will be more around 8 weeks. They also said they would escalate the case. At 8 weeks I called again and this time they said it will be more like 3 months to get the refund, but they reassured me they would escalate the case again. The following week I went back to the agent in NYC to see what she can do. She discovered that the claim was still pending and had been “Neglected” (her words). She told me it would serve me better to start a new claim to get new attention to the case, and she reassured me that this would not mean that I would lose my turn and have to wait another 3 months from then. At 2 months and 3 weeks I called the headquarters again, and with such chutzpah they told me my new claim was filed only a week ago and I need to wait for 90 days from the new claim to get my refund, which would mean basically 6 months from the date of the cancelled flight. As I really refused to take no for an answer, they put me through to the manager. She told me the reason the NYC agent issued me a new claim number was because there was a mistake in the way the original claim was filed and it had been rejected, not neglected. Meanwhile, nobody had bothered to call me when such rejection was done to tell me there was problem with the claim and see how we can fix it. She was also adamant that she cannot do anything else at this moment and that I will have to wait 90 more days from the filing of the new claim to see my refund. She again said she will escalate the matter, which by now we all know means nothing. She refused to give any assistance at all. Many phone calls to the headquarters and a few trips to the NYC local office, I’m still not even sure when or how I will ever get back the money from my two round trip business class seats on Avianca. They were happy to take thousands of dollars from me, changed our tickets on us without consulting us first, and now are creating all kinds of roadblocks and delay tactics in refunding the money. Even though they made a mistake in filing of the refund claim, they never bothered admitting to their mistake, nor are they taking any responsibility for a mistake that was done by their agent.

Cabin crew were a little rough and could use some soft skills training but they are not the worst by far. Food and drink was good, beer a bit warm. Overall the flight was a delight and the AV system and headphones are on par with other long haul carriers. I will say that Avianca does and did make changes to the itinerary several, and I mean several times, you can call them and they were nice and easy to deal with on the phone. BOG was a great place to visit and if you go, I recommend Avianca.",5,5,0,Boeing 787,Avianca

On my return flight to Miami from Bogota, originally scheduled for 2pm on January 2nd, 2018, I had to wait in line at the Bogota airport for 1 and a half hour. They did not have enough staff on the counters (about 2/3 positions empty); when I finally got to the counter at 11:00 am, I was told that I would not fly on the pm flight because it had been oversold, just like that. Unbelievable for a ticket secure over 3 months prior. I ended up leaving Bogota at 10:45 pm that night after multiple delays in a very old plane with its seats literally falling apart.

All the advertisements and information for Avianca's business class were showcasing beautiful laydown seats. What gives? Even the flight attendant was saying that these are really old planes and Avianca does not care about upgrading. My parents had four business class flights and only 1 was the real business class. We complained to Avianca and they said they can change planes up to the minute they fly so even if we buy a ticket with plane X with laydown business class seats they will change to plane Y with horrible business class seats but we still have to pay.

I was not asked for proof of vaccination at check in. When I was prevented from boarding the aircraft I was also told that my bag had not been loaded so Avianca staff had obviously been aware of the situation for some time, but no one had contacted me while I had been in the lounge for three hours to advise me of the situation, if they had I could have obtained the vaccination at El Dorado airport during this time. Avianca made me pay to rebook my flight and I had to pay for a hotel before resuming my travel to Santa Cruz Bolivia the next day where on arrival I was told that a yellow fever vaccination was not required!

The left-side rear bathroom door on the aircraft used for flight 904 from MVD to LIM on March 22 had an open gap with the doorframe, so after you sat down, you realized you were exposed to the galley. Cabin Crew were excellent across all 6 flights, unlike other airlines where they tend to disappear soon after take-off (Aerolineas Argentinas comes to mind). There are no seat-back pockets, so your knees enjoy a bit of extra leg room but you don’t have a place to store small items such as your bottle of water. Not all flights offer blankets, but all flights get very cold (so, dress accordingly).

Similar to my previous experiences with Avianca, these were all excellent flights with a decent level of service. Avianca now use the Boeing 787 on the London-Bogota route, which is probably my favourite plane to fly long haul (not that the previous A330 was bad). The tinted windows, higher pressurisation, gentle lighting and more spacious cabin of the 787s make a big difference when you are on a 10+ hour flight. Avianca cabin crew were more friendly on this occasion than previously, and the IFE offering on the Boeing 787 was also very good. Only complaint about the long-haul legs is the food: on the way out the offerings weren't too bad, but the BOG-LHR return flight featured some of the worst airline food I've had in recent years. Domestic flights were very pleasant and all ran on time. Medellin airport is unfortunately quite far out of the city, but check-in was a breeze and the trip to Cartagena takes less than an hour. Decent inflight service, with free drinks, for such a short flight. Baggage reclaim in Cartagena was rapid. On my return flight from Santa Marta to Bogota (connecting to LHR), I arrived very early at Santa Marta airport (3 hours before my flight). The friendly check-in agent offered me a seat on an earlier flight to Bogota which saved me 2 hours of sitting in Santa Marta airport, where there is absolutely nothing to do. This also saved me having to worry about rushing a connection between terminals in Bogota, and gave me plenty of time to charge my electronics and find food at BOG before my international flight. I'd continue to use Avianca for connections to Latin America: the direct LHR-BOG flight on its own is a major plus, compared to having to transfer in a US airport (with the associated hassle of US immigration and re-checking bags, etc).",3,4,0,Boeing 787 / A320 / A318,Avianca

The patience with which customer service talks to you, even in repeat calls, different questions, long conversations, etc. In about 15 calls only one I had to wait in queue for 2 minutes, a welcome change after dealing with customer service centers in USA where 20 minutes of wait times are a norm. The consideration they gave to me and my wife after knowing that I am injured and need to go back to hometown to get treatment due to my medical history is commendable.

After a long time on hold I reached someone at this number who informed me that no one could help us reschedule until 5:30am when the office opened.

In other words there was absolutely no weather issue in Costa Rica or San Salvador or in between. It was the smirks on the agent's faces when they told us there was nothing they would do to help us that was especially galling. The idiotic run around from the airport to the phone center to the airport wasted the time when we could used to make alternate arrangements. While we waited to learn what Avianca was going to do for us alternate ticket prices skyrocketed. Why couldn't they have just told us our flight would be Tuesday morning and they would do nothing to help us at 4am when we were face to face at the airport?

The plane was delayed, finally boarding passes were issued, we boarded the aircraft and waited and waited. We had been able to eat small bite at around midday before boarding our first Avianca flight (AV9551) from Cartagena to Bogota but nothing to eat or drink since, and we were hungry and thirsty by the time we boarded.

We were offered a drink at that time, but I had to repeat my request for both wine and water. The cabin staff seemed utterly oblivious to passenger needs. All the cabin lights went out leaving cabins in total, velvety black darkness. I was not able to call for more water although I pressed the call button regularly.

The first eight of these were uneventful, service was good - modern, clean aircraft (A330, A320 and A319) with excellent seat pitch for economy and decent inflight food and drink service. Personal IFE screens on most flights, even short (less than 2 hour) legs on A320/A319 aircraft, which is pretty much unheard of for major European carriers. All of these flights arrived either early or within 10 minutes of scheduled arrival time which was impressive. The real measure of an airline though is when things go wrong. AV120 from BOG-LHR on 28th Sept was severely delayed due to a faulty plane (impact on one of the engines). Avianca ground staff were excellent given the circumstances. No long waiting around without information at the airport; just 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time of 2304 an announcement was made to say the plane would not be leaving that night, and was rescheduled for 1330 the next afternoon. Although inevitably this led to a scrum of people angrily shouting at the staff (I really don't understand why so many people think they are more important than everyone else), the staff were helpful and patient, and within an hour I was sat in a 5 star airport hotel with food. The next morning Avianca paid for breakfast, lunch, gave me a $375 voucher redeemable on a future flight and the rescheduled flight left just after 1330 as planned. Only real criticisms I would make of Avianca through my whole experiences would be that announcements in English as well as Spanish would have been helpful (although the staff all explained in English when asked. My IFE screen broke halfway through the flight home and couldn't be fixed.

We booked these overnight flights to make the most of our limited time in Colombia. However our outbound flight was delayed due to a technical fault and we were kept waiting at the gate until about 11.30pm when they finally decided that we wouldn't be leaving that night. The arrangements weren't very well communicated and we ended up standing outside the airport in the freezing cold waiting for buses to take us to the provided overnight hotel. We were also unable to retrieve our hold luggage (perhaps because the airport had mostly shut down by then) so had to manage with just what we had in our carry on luggage. We were initially told that the flight would leave at 12pm the next day but eventually it left at about 5pm - a delay of almost 19 hours. We were put on a replacement plane which was very new and reasonably comfortable (although our pre-booked seats were not honoured so we ended up on the back row of the cabin near the toilets). The main meal was pretty tasty actually and the cabin crew were reasonable polite. However once the meal service was over there was no sign of any cabin crew until breakfast the next day. On long haul flights with other airlines the cabin crew come through every so often with glasses of water or fruit juice to help keep hydrated so it was disappointing not to have that simple touch on this flight. The breakfast did include cereal with yoghurt though which I did like! Our return flight left on time thankfully and was back on the usual Star Alliance branded plane which didn't feel quite as new and shiny as the one we'd flown out on. Shortly after takeoff we entered some turbulence which lasted about 30 minutes - it would have been nice if the pilot had communicated this with us before take off like other airlines often do. There was in fact very little communication from the pilot (in Spanish or English). The inflight entertainment was reasonable but with only a limited selection of films. We landed back at LHR about an hour early but then had to wait because there was a technical problem getting our bags off the plane.

I was flying with my one year old daughter from JFK to Guatemala and had a stop with a layover of 4 hours. As soon as I got off the plane I had to wait for them to give me my stroller for about 20 minutes. When I finally got my stroller the flight attendant informed me my flight was delayed by 3 more hours (bringing the total layover time to 7 hours! with a baby and with absolutely no explanation or reason for the delay). Once the time came for preparing to board there was not one employee from Avianca at the gate. No one to ask for info no one to ask what was going on. The time came for when we were actually supposed to be taking off and still no one and still no explanation as to why. Eventually an hour later we boarded. On the way back home I got to the check in and had to wait until the counter staff showed up 2 hours before the flight (again no explanation or apology). When I got to my stop in El Salvador they almost lost my stroller because they thought it was supposed to stay in El Salvador even though it clearly said on the tag to give it to me there and that I had to go to Newark. At El Salvador Avianca airport it was extremely chaotic (also no scanners for carry on so I almost lost my flight because it took so long with each person).,4,4,0,Not specified,Avianca

This comment refers to my last flight from Bogota to Barranquilla in Business Class. AV now uses El Dorado Terminal for many domestic flights (for the routes with highest traffic) which is convenient especially if you have to connect to international flights. The lounge has also improved but it is mostly very crowded. Long queues at the entrance. Outbound A318 inbound A320. Business Class seats spacious very nice compared to the European ""middle seat free"" concept. AVOD available also on domestic flights (even so in Y). These are the positive aspects. Now to the negative points: As mentioned before Lounge in BOG is always crowded lounge in BAY even worse in the evening it makes no sense to enter you don't find any space. F&B offering ok but always picked within 2 minutes. AV says they provide you with Food in the Lounge so they dont provide any food onboard not even in C Class. Not even a pack of peanuts! So when you don't find space in the Lounge you have to go and buy something because onboard you wont get anything! This is very poor for an airline that wants to present itself as the industry leader in Latin America! The crew is mostly nice and gentle and because of the nice seat I rate them 5/10 for the experience in domestic C Class. If it was European concept with middle seat free I would not even rate them 1/10 because apart from the mentioned negative points the ticket prices are very high for C Class.",1,5,0,Not specified,Avianca

While the outbound leg (AV10 Nov 3) featured a disinterested and rude crew and provided a below standard business class food and beverage offer the return early morning flight proved a great difference beginning with the greatly appointed Velazquez IB lounge in MAD with an expansive F&B and amenities offer which is a huge contrast with the substandard and rude AV lounge in BOG. Return AV 27 (Nov 8) offered a good early morning breakfast (almost a brunch) and then a fairly good lunch with a reasonable wine and spirits offer all of them served by a rather friendly crew. Arrival in BOG at 1pm avoids the rush and chaos of the tiny and third-world shaped EDR international terminal. I would fly them again when upgraded.

The flights never left on-time and on-average left an hour and a half after the scheduled departure time. Due to connecting flights there was about a 15 minute grace period getting off one flight and going through customs immigration and then through security again to get to the next gate (flight crew did not provide instruction whether there was a way to skip all of these steps ahead of time). In addition on an early morning 3-hour flight a friend observed the entire flight crew napping in the back of the plane. I find this appalling.

The crew from Miami to Bogota were completely uninterested in attending to passengers after the meal was served. During the meal I asked for a wine and water. One attendant said: normally only one beverage is served per passenger! The cup of wine is tiny (half of a normal cup)! The food was a joke have never seen smaller portions on routes over 3 hours. 3 mini- strips of meat tasteless. No salt or pepper available on board. The airline is the only one I know with a Duty Free seller on board. I wanted to buy a whiskey but it was not available. This person was not friendly or enthusiastic at all. After arrival in Bogotá the crew did not say goodbye they were just packing their stuff. Who invented this terrible new seat? For small people maybe nice for tall people like me a disaster - the headrest hurts my neck. Seat pitch was better some years ago. The service on the domestic routes did not convince me either. They only serve bad coffee or artificial juices. The planes are new but not very well cleaned. Positive: All my flights were on time.

On the plus side there is free wifi so we were able to track Avianca's inbound flight - which was almost an hour late landing. The airport is just too small to cope with boarding two planes simultaneously - it was a nightmare! The crew did a good job of turning the aircraft quickly and we were boarded fairly quickly. Ignored by staff at the boarding door who were more interested in their own conversation - other crew much more proactive. Very new A320 new leather seats with excellent legroom and large TV with a range of AVOD TV programmes you can start watching straight away.

With over 4.5 million miles flown I have experienced all types of airlines and routes. None however match Avianca in sheer mediocrity. Our issues began with their phone reservation system we made some changes that were never registered when we arrived to check in. Our flight connected through BOG but the check in person did not know whether or not our bags would go through. She said ""ask in BOG"". Ok. Our flight was 1 hour and 40 minutes late so we missed our connection. No one from Avianca was there to greet connecting passengers. No information. In customs we were told by one Avianca person to wait for the bags then another to go to the connecting flight area. We had three possible connecting times but their poor handling of passengers made us all miss them. Turns out the bags were not checked through but my wife found them an hour later in the carrousel. We spent the night in Bogota paid by Avianca and then proceeded the next day chaotic conditions throughout. Never again. All flights miss timetables but it's how the situation is handled where the good are separated from the bad. Avianca doesn't even make the ""bad"" category. Their fleet is modern Airbuses but the pitch is so tight that forget using your laptop to work on the plane if the person in front reclines. So that's bad too.

Sufficient staff at the airports to keep the check-in lines short. Never had to wait longer than 5-10 min. Ground crew as well as flight crew friendly and efficient. They give you the feeling that you are a guest and not just a pax. Decent on-board service on mainly brand-new airbus aircraft. The brand new ones have 'mood lightning' in the cabin which is very nice on night flights. Decent on-board service. Even on a 1hr-flight they serve a small snack and beverages for free incl. alcoholic drinks. Full meal on the 2hr flight UIO-LIM. Food quality is nothing fancy but it's ok. In theory they offer also a free in-seat entertainment system. However not all aircraft are equipped with it even not some brand new ones. On the 2 legs where it was existent it was out of order. Here is room to improve and provide the same standard at least on flights over 2 or 3 hrs. So if you need entertainment bring your own or a good book since you don't know what you get.

Only issue I have had was being turned out of the emergency exit seat on a domestic flight when the crew member briefing me on the emergency procedure for that row discovered I didn't speak Spanish. Since most the passengers did not speak English there was not much I could say really.

Tickets not very cheap though (USD 900 for two persons) but very close to the only two competitors available for this route (LAN and COPA). The only problem with Avianca national flights is the Puente Aereo terminal they use in Bogota kind of small and overcrowded building while the brand new international terminal (El Dorado) is a state of the art facility.

Served breakfast shortly after take off and it was rather good but afterwards flight attendants disappeared until one hour before landing.

The worst was the service and the quality and quantity of the food. The stewards were never seen in the cabin except during the meal distribution. During the flight we got two small hot meals which were both poor in quality. I had much preferred a single but better quality hot meal and before the landing a small snack.

I used to be a fan of Avianca. It's usually a reliable airline but it's new business class is a mess. On short haul (if you can call a 6 hour flight from Bogota to NYC or Santiago short haul) seat comfort is terrible: almost zero recline and ridiculous pitch between rows. On long haul (A330) they just installed new angled seats which are terrible to sleep on. So if you go to Europe chose Iberia instead (fully flat) and within region LAN remains unbeatable in comfort and service. In Avianca the food service is also mediocre and the wine choice (Trio and Trivento - both very average) is the same for 24 months now. The only good elements are IFE on demand and the flight attendants who are friendly. Boarding in Bogota is a mess (no priority lanes) and lounge is also mediocre without enough seats on peak periods.,0,0,0,Not specified,Avianca

It's not just that food is getting worse (the new menu to NYC is basically inedible) you can't get a glass of wine on domestic routes (free rum and whiskey only) the uncomfortable A320 turns up on more and more NYC routes and the lounges are stuffy and overcrowded. The most disappointing part of the service is that Avianca makes absolutely no effort to ease the way for premium passengers through the deplorable Colombian airports. There are no dedicated security lines no fast track through immigration (which can take up to two hours in BOG on bad days) and when you finally make it to the plane there is no priority boarding. Obviously equal misery for all is a well tested concept - it's called the discount airline. That seems to be where Avianca is headed - surely with its present state of service there is no way to mistake it for the serious world class airline it wants to be. The only reason I keep recommending Avianca is because Delta Continental and American are hardly attractive alternatives.

Most of the time Avianca uses A319/320 in this route. These planes have a terrible business class seat with limited recline. They are good for a 2 hour flight but not for a long flight such as BOG-JFK (aprox 6 hours). If you are lucky to fly 767 or the new A330 in this route you will have a good service from Avianca but not in these smaller planes. AVOD has a decent choice and food service was OK (although I think that travellers would prefer a breakfast before arrival at 6am than a dinner at departure time on mid-night). It's sad to see Avianca placing a bet on this seat configuration for long routes such as Santiago or JFK since comfort level is substandard.,0,0,0,Not specified,Avianca

A small but tasty meal is served with colombian coffee and good-quality whisky. All free of charge! Female flight attendants are courteous and attentive but their male counterparts can be less so. One downside not Avianca's fault is the international wing at Bogota's Eldorado airport. Completely uninspiring not providing even an intercom system. Flights are called by the gate agents in loud voices as if we were in a bus station.

Nobody to meet transit passengers at the gate (J class plus highest elite status apparently not worth any extra attention). On own initiative despite an endless line I still made it through immigration with half an hour to spare plenty of time to make it to connecting plane. But no transfer desk looked aghast at my early appearance and stood firm that all domestic transfers had been closed. Overnight in Bogota but oops all of Bogota sold out except the downtown Tequendama which I don't wish on my worst enemy. That's where this airline despite major improvements over the last couple of years still allows bureaucracy to kill customer service initiative. Had there been an agent to take us through immigration and put us into a car to our connecting plane AV would have made friends for life. (And saved a bunch of money.)

This is a classic sentence said by customers, and I really hope we will never need to buy tickets with Azul again. We tried to book a flight from Manaus to Rio de Janeiro, but the process was extremely complicated because we are not Brazilian and don’t have a CPF. It took forever, and we had to try multiple times. Eventually, we managed to book the tickets and received a confirmation email, so we assumed everything was fine. However, a few days later, we realized they had sent another email saying the payment was pending—for reasons unknown. No problem, we thought. Let’s try again. That’s when the real trouble began. We wanted to pay again using a card, but it wasn’t possible. They offered PIX as a payment option, but as foreigners, we don’t have access to PIX. What were we supposed to do? We tried to contact customer service. We called 5-6 different numbers, sent an email, and even messaged them on Facebook and Instagram. No response—until, finally, after 15 minutes on hold, someone picked up. The Azul representative told us the only way to fix the payment issue was to go to the Manaus airport in person, up to four hours before the flight. This was not a solution for us. We were on an organized tour in the Amazon and couldn’t just leave—and it’s 2024, so why couldn’t they send us a payment link to finalize the process? Still, the answer was no. Finally, a kind Brazilian offered to help us pay via PIX. We sent her the payment link, but it expired in just seven minutes. We sent another link, but after that, we weren’t given another chance to try. The result? We had to cancel a night and a day of our tour, lose money, and deal with immense frustration. Azul’s customer service is nonexistent. They don’t help, and they seem to actively make things difficult for foreigners by requiring CPF for booking and PIX for payment.

I did not receive a confirmation e-mail upon buying my tickets. I could not find my reservations on the website either, and had to write the company on Facebook to confirm that they existed. To be fair, the Facebook staff was responsive and efficient -- why do they not assign these people to the actual website? There appear to be multiple redundant versions of the company's platform, in multiple languages, and I was kicked between these versions seemingly at random every time I clicked on anything. Online check-in was a three-hour-long living nightmare: the website as a whole seemed to stop working outright multiple times, every step of the procedure (when they happened at all) stalled my laptop for twenty to thirty seconds, and I had to redo the whole thing five or six times, before it actually went through at around one in the morning. As I write this review, I am attempting to check-in for my return flight, which I had the misfortune of taking with Azul as well: I have been trying for over two hours and it will not work. They apparently expect all passengers to have a valid Brazilian CPF (ID number), a phone number fitting in Brazilian standards, and other such information that only exists in Brazil. I am lucky to have lived in Brazil before, else I would have been entirely lost.  I tried buying extra luggage three times through two different versions of the site, one demanded that I have a valid CPF, and the other did not process my payment. Fast-forwarding to the luggage check-in at the airport in Paris, there was only one counter for Economy class.  Business class had four, if I recall. The flight itself was fine. Nothing worth writing home about one way or another. But when you are left more tired and stressed-out by online check-in, a process supposed to last five minutes, than by the subsequent nineteen-hour flight, that is a problem.

This is a tale of two aircraft in business class. Outbound on A330-200, inbound A330 Neo. I expected some differences between the experience on the different aircraft but was unprepared for what transpired. The A330-200 was comfortable, if perhaps a bit tired feeling. The A330 Neo felt new but was the worst business class experience in memory. The Neo cabin immediately felt claustrophobic upon entering. It felt as though they jammed in far too many seats in a small area. Then the seats themselves were extraordinarily uncomfortable and equally as claustrophobic. It led to this being a surprisingly poor experience.  When in recline mode, your legs disappear and slide under the IFE screen and other hardware of the shell. From mid thigh downward, you are trapped in a very narrow space which ends at about one foot high and less than one foot wide. It is impossible for your feet to rest without touching anything. It is impossible to roll over on your side and the height of your stacked knees and legs doesn't fit in the space.  Extraordinarily uncomfortable, in fact the most uncomfortable business class seat in memory. Was totally surprised that this happened on Azul, as I would expect much, much better of them. It's clear to me that they rolled out this product without soliciting opinions of actual travelers, and they are responsible for this mess. The crew confirmed I wasn't the first to mention this. I vowed never to do this again, as it was a complete waste of money. The rest of the experience was actually good - professional crews, punctual flights, ok food but for me the seat is by far the only thing that matters and Azul and Airbus are both guilty of jointly delivering a terrible product.

We booked Azul because of its good reputation but we’re shockingly disappointed in their service. The flight was delayed without explanation; however, the attendants allowed the passengers to stand in the breezeway and then sit on an extremely hot plane for an hour (as long as the flight should have been). We were only told that the reason the flight was delayed was due to being overweight because we asked an attendant. He explained that they would remove cargo so that we can have our flight. The Azul employees announced where to go for the baggage like normal. When we arrived in Salvador we waited at baggage claim for more than 30 minutes without explanation. Then only because we asked did an Azul employee explain that Azul did not lose baggage but rather decided to leave every single checked bag back in Recife without explanation, warning, or apology. We were then offered the option to sit in the airport for 3 hours to wait for our bags when we are only in Salvador for 2 days. The Azul staff were extremely unhelpful and would not replace medication or other necessities that were immediately needed. We spoke with a manager who did not give any appropriate reasoning for why the airline would choose to prioritize cargo over their own passengers who paid for their seats. She also refused to replace items that were immediately necessary and suggested that it could be more than a day before we get our bags (when again, we are only here for 2 days). Azul was extremely disrespectful to their international and local clients by making this decision and how they dealt with justifiably frustrated clients.

Eventually someone who had to speak to me said ”didn’t you receive the mail?” Why insult your passengers with complete lies, it was never sent. Basically the flight was delayed by 5 hours. Generously, they had re-scheduled my connection in Lisboa. The lounge at VCP is quite basic, very little choice on either food or drink, so being stuck in it for 7 hours was quite depressing. Luckily the net worked very well. Eventually I got on the plane. The food served in business class was very poor for an international flight. Beef in sauce, rice, potato sticks. I have a Brasilian wife, I know what the local food is like, this was poor. Then the selection of “fine” cheeses for dessert. What an insult. No taste, all soft cheeses, biscuits still in the wrapper. Then the bed - very thin and old padding, you could feel everything underneath you, being 1.87M tall I could not stretch and slept in a curl.

On return we noticed only 3 international flights for the whole day. It makes no economic sense to use this airport as your hub. We were very pleased with economy flights, 40 euro each way and served a snack. Our issue is the lack of service on the 10 hour business class flights. The seat and design is good and matches all the products out there. It's the service, you get served a meal and then stewards disappear for the rest of the flight until breakfast a little over an hour before landing. This was a daytime flight crossing only two time zones. I shouldn't have to ask for a drink. I believe this policy needs to change. Also the meal itself was presented well but tasted like an economy meal and was lukewarm. It's presented all together so you have to eat starter quickly before your main goes cold.

Our third and 4th flight, was going to be Azul. Azul was by far, way more friendly and customer service oriented than GOL. Unfortunately, as we had booked our tickets on a discount site, we were not easily able to get our tickets changed to an earlier flight - but when we got to the airport 3 hours earlier than planned in Cuiaba, the check in clerk let a translator know that there were seats open on a flight that would get us into Iguacu at midnight instead of 6am. Unfortunately because of the discount site, we did not qualify to do so. But the fact that a company would go out of its way to do this for us is awesome in my opinion. It shows that as a company, they really care about their customers! The only downside (which was shared with GOL) that you should be aware of, is that if you have a connecting flight of more than 4 hours you will need to pick up your luggage and re-check it in. Mind you, the first time we experienced this was with GOL and they had not warned us that this was going to happen. When we were checking in with Azul, they told us that when we reached our 2nd connection as we were going to be there for 6 hours, we would need to pick up our luggage and then check it back in 2hrs before our flight. Another great thing is that (at least at this point in time) most of their staff seemed to know English, which is very very helpful for travelers that aren't from Portugal or Brazil. I am not sure of what other languages they may or may not know. But it was very comforting actually being able to understand somebody. The last thing, and I am not sure whether this is supposed to be standard practice, or if we just got lucky on 5 flights, is that they had a wide selection of snacks on-board. and you didnt have to pick just one.

If you plan to use a non-Brasilian credit or debit card in Brasil, the golden rule is make sure it is 'unlocked' for use in Brasil for the period in use or they may likely decline it for security reasons (we use both, but our business card is a UK one). But what if you don't notice that it is going through Brasilian verification? Online it usually makes no difference: this time it did. I booked a flight with Azul, which I've done many times. The booking went through but they said there was a small problem on the card which was not unlocked. I phoned Mastercard and made sure it was unlocked. The Azul confirmation came through again, saying the payment and flight was confirmed. Mastercard also said that that specific payment had been confirmed when I spoke to them. The next day, an email arrived from Azul saying there is a problem. I spend an hour on the phone with them but the upshot is that they said they had refunded the amount (this later turned out to be untrue) because of the initial problem. They asked me to send email photographs of the front of my credit card and passport (which in itself breaks Internet security protocols and their agreements with Mastercard). They assured me that was the only way to sort it out and it would all be confirmed and sorted out in thirty minutes so reluctantly I sent them. Two hours and more long distance phone calls later, the person who had made the promise had gone home and the new person said the flight would have to be paid for again and not with that card (there is nothing wrong with the card). Now I know the airline gurus on here will say, Oh it's all your fault, you should have done such-and-such, but the mistakes or problems I encountered (as someone who books many flights) could happen to anyone, which is why I am sharing the story. So when the offices open again I phone Mastercard again. They tell that the payment was definitely approved (and supplied the authorisation code) and that the transaction had definitely gone through (and provided me with the transaction code) and that it definitely had not been refunded. I asked if there was a refund pending and they said there was not any refund pending. When confronted with this, they (Azul) changed their story and said it hadn't been refunded but it would be refunded once the payment was made in person at their office. This required my partner to take several hours off, take a taxi from Sao Paulo to Barueri (where the Azul office is situated, a journey of about 25km with tolls and heavy traffic that can take over an hour) and pay cash for something that they, Azul, had already received cash for and still had cash for. (Presumably if we had accepted them at their word, that the money had been refunded, and just changed to a flight with TAM, bearing in mind this is two days before travel, they would not have refunded it at all.) The other 'option' they offered was for my partner to take the money to the airport and pay for the flight and that they would refund the money to the credit card after she had done so. (The first option meant lost time and expense, the second one arriving at the airport without a guaranteed flight carrying more money than is desirable when travelling around.) We decided we had few choices but to pay for the flight twice in the hope that the money will eventually be refunded and an e-ticket issued.",0,0,1,Not specified,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras

However, when we got to La Paz they didn't give priority to transit passengers or even ask about it. They let us out of the plane right on the runway after approximately 10 minutes of waiting for a bus that never came and they made us walk all the way to the airport. Mind that we couldn't run because our bodies are not used to being in such altitudes and we could suffer mortal consequences. As a result, we missed our flight therefore we also missed pre-arranged tour bookings in our final destination. We expected better customer service because no one oriented us or gave priority to those with connecting flights. We asked the airline staff and no one knew nothing.

The staff stated that his baggage would put the plane overweight and wouldn't allow him to board the plane. This is against the contract as each passenger is allowed to have a checked-in luggage for free. In our case, they didn't let him pass at all even though we made it before their counters closed. So Boliviana de Aviacion put us in the next plane, which by consequence we would miss our next flight, but they couldn't care less.

We did a lot of planning and I took care of getting our Copa plane tickets from David, Panama to Aruba. I went to the Copa office in David to buy the tickets and I asked the agent if we needed to have anything besides our passports to travel to Aruba. She told me no, that all we needed was our passports to be current. About 10 days before our departure, I went back to the Copa office in David to inquire about our connection in Panama City. We only had 1 hour and 5 minutes to make the connection and the airplanes arriving from David and departing to Aruba tend to be in different terminals with no good transportation between the two, plus you have to go through security again. She assured me that the flight would wait on us. I was skeptical since I had been left by Copa at least twice in the past on other connecting flights when the flights ran late and not because of weather. In those instances Copa did nothing to accommodate me even though it was their fault. I asked her again if we needed anything else to fly to Aruba. No, she said, just your passports. We checked in online yesterday and printed our boarding passes. Today when we went to the airport and went to the agent desk to drop our checked bags, they informed us that we had to have a Yellow Fever card. I explained that I had asked on two occasions at the Copa office regarding any other requirements beyond our passports and had been told nothing else was needed. After getting nowhere with the agent, Diego Polando, I asked to speak to his supervisor. The lady supervisor, Ashley Duarte showed up with armed police and informed me that no we could not fly. I was shocked that she would show up with armed police. We never raised our voice or showed any threatening behavior. After it was obvious that they were not going to let us go on the airplane, I asked for a refund. They refused. Needless to say I am appalled at Copa's behavior.

I’ve had a few flights with them lately, they are fine on short distance, but absolutely horrible long-haul. I’d understand their low standard if it was a budget airline, but their flights certainly weren’t cheap. I had a 7hour flight from Panama to Las Vegas. There was only one meal, no snacks, as you’d get with most airlines. But what was shocking is that they don’t have any special meals. As a vegetarian I couldn’t select vegetarian meal in advance, assuming they’d have a veggie option during the flight. How wrong was I! The two options they had was beef and chicken. Just as well I had the sense and bought something (overpriced) at the airport, so I wasn’t left starving the whole flight. I was very disappointed though, at this day and age special meals should be automatically included.  Their staff doesn’t seem to be well trained or have basic customer service skills either. Felt like they selected a few spare people at the airport, threw them into the plane to act as stewards. One was walking around and shouting like he was at a market stall, the other two seemed to be more interested in sharing their personal lives than us as paying customers. And another shocking part of the flight was that there are no screens on seats. For a long-haul flight. The only option was to connect to their Wifi, which was free for the entertainment channel, and watch it on the phone. With own earphones. Which was hard since I needed to charge my phone and had only wired earphones with me.

When I attempted to change the final destination (to Salvador), I was informed that I couldn't even change the date because such changes must be requested more than 8 days ahead of time. This means I paid $65 for the ability to change the outgoing date within the next 2 days. Despite receiving conflicting information from various customer service representatives, my request to cancel the entire flight due to the unsuitable itinerary was refused. They offered credit for the same route, valid for a year, but I requested credit for a different destination within the Star Alliance's network, which was also denied.

Despite waiting in line ahead of time to check in, when I finally made it to the check-in counter, the agent claimed they had called for passengers for my flight, but I did not hear any announcements in English or see important messages on the screens.

I then took the advice of the customer service attendant of Copa and went downstairs and tried to find someone from Copa in the  checkin. Nobody there as well. I then go through security again, carrying heavy bags and go to the gate that it was originally in  to find that it has now changed to the other side of the terminal with no prior announcement. I then get to B18 gate and am told that they can’t make any changes or reservations for my connecting flight there even though I got told they can through the customer service hotline and that I will need to wait until I get to Panama and see what they can throw us with no additional information they were willing to give us at all. I have no idea if I will be flying same day or have to get a different flight to another day, if I have to pay for my own accommodation etc. The service has been sub par and this has left a bad taste in my mouth that has made my mind up to never fly Copa again.",0,0,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Skyscanner search engine came up with a roundtrip around 500 USD with Copa Airlines, a company which I’ve never heard from before. Before booking I did some research and almost decided not to book with them due to all the really bad reviews about Copa. I’m glad I gave them a try. I had an excellent trip in almost every aspect. Check in at LAX was quick, friendly and easy. The young lady gave me seats on exit rows for both flights upon request without extra charge. I’m 6-2 so I was really glad to get seats with extra leg space in economy. The trip to São Paulo goes via Panama City, their hub. The connection there was the easiest thing I’ve ever experienced. We arrived at one gate and the connecting flight left immediately next to it. The planes left on time and arrived on time as well. On long distance flights you do get a selection of warm meals. Not bad, not good. Nothing special. If this is important to you: they don’t serve alcoholic beverages. Inflight entertainment works with your smartphone or tablet. You can log into the wifi and and get access to movies and tv shows. It’s not a huge selection but enough to find something you like. Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful on all flights. The trip back was basically the same. Everything was fine. For me this was a smooth trip with zero issues. Food could be better, but hey, its economy class after all.

On the first leg to Panama City I checked in at El Dorado and was at the gate within 30 minutes altogether. Because I purchased a basic economy ticket I had to pay to check in a bag but it was actually very cheap only thirty dollars. One thing I did not like was that you can’t buy alcohol at duty free if you travel through Panama City otherwise they’ll confíscate it or make you pay to check it in so I missed out on bringing back rum. Had I known that rule I would have bought it and put it in the checked in bad in Bogota. The flight itself was uneventful, the airplane had private TVs on each seat, flight attendants were normal not too friendly just basically did their job. in Panama City I went to duty free bought some booze which was given to me at the door. On this flight the crew were extremely attentive and very nice. There was a change of planes from a Max9 to 737-800 at the last minute. Headphones were handed out after take off, about an hour and a half into the flight dinner was served but there were no choices it was some kind of beef and beans with corn bread and a cake slice. For drinks no alcohol is offered not even to buy which sucks but they do have some really good guava and pineapple juice. There was another drink service after dinner and two water services after.

After ten years, we decided to spend Christmas and New Year's in Brazil, and due to the pandemic, the ticket prices were exorbitant. Copa seemed to be the most reasonable option available. However, our experience with Copa left much to be desired. The food quality was poor, and the entertainment options were just average on flights to Panama City and Belo Horizonte. To make matters worse, both of our flights were delayed. The discomfort of the seats was exacerbated by the fact that they only operate with 737 aircraft. On our return journey to Canada, the flight faced yet another delay, and to our disappointment, there was no onboard entertainment unless you were willing to watch on your own device. Things took a stressful turn when we landed in Panama City just as our connecting flight to Toronto was boarding. We had to sprint and walk for a good 15-20 minutes to reach another terminal to catch our flight home. In the midst of the chaos, our family of three got separated, and our son was momentarily lost. Upon reaching the boarding gate, there was pressure on us to board immediately. However, we couldn't comply as we were anxiously waiting for our son, and we had his travel documents with us. To our dismay, as soon as we finally boarded, the aircraft closed its doors and took off promptly. It was the only flight that departed on time throughout our journey. In conclusion, if you have no alternative, consider flying with Copa Airlines. But be prepared by bringing your own snacks; otherwise, you might go hungry.

I originally had a flight leaving Lima, Peru to San Francisco via Panama City on July 31. I was going to have a 50 minute connection and was trusting that I was going to make it, as we were going through the company's hub. However, 20 mins after the plane boards, we got the message that the plane had equipment issues and was going to deboard. Not much more information given after that, and we were taken to baggage claim to get our luggage. I had to find out from other passengers that we had to go to a random airport gate to get rebooked - and this took almost 3 hours. The company booked us a hotel and shuttle to a hotel, but the whole process was very painful and lacked clear communication. The next morning the flight was scheduled to depart at 10am. We arrive to the airport at 7, and find out that the flight then got delayed to 1pm. At 1pm the flight then got rescheduled to 3pm. By this point, everyone would have missed their various connecting flights out of Panama City, including mine, to San Francisco. By the way, there is only 1 flight to San Francisco per day out of Panama, leaving at 6:15pm and arriving at 11:30pm. Instead of making it easier for me and finding a solution, they were going to rebook me on the next flight which would have meant another day wasted. I had to fight them to get a solution to fly me to LAX and then to San Francisco via United. Overall, very frustrating travel experience. I had hopes for this airline due to its Star Alliance status but it was very poor. The staff during the whole experience were very poor at communicating, were on their phones the whole time, sometimes rude, did not try to assist very much.

Well once we did, the “value” of the ticket suddenly dropped to like $900 (because that’s what the new route would have cost in cash). 6 hours later, after sleeping a little and coming up with a new idea, tried to change it one more time to a different routing that would cash $1050. Copa agent insisted we would have to pay the ticket value difference of $150 (plus a change fee, annoying but understandable).  We called back and got a more empathetic agent, she could reduce it a little bit her software literally wouldn’t let her wave the fair difference even though we had clearly originally paid an exorbitant about above the new ticket price. Copa agents routinely told us “that is not possible” and insulted my intelligence when discussing fees. Some of this is language barriers, but not an excuse for the snarkiness.

I told him I had paid extra to be in the window and more room, he told me to tell the mother to move the kid from my paid/assigned seat (Paid an extra $65 btw for that). It was pretty embarrassing to be honest, the guy was on a power trip somehow, so I just sat back and kept my mouth shut, but the whole flight I had to be pushed to the aisle because there was just so much room for both of our bodies.  If I had the chance to be on my seat, I could just roll on to the wall and be fine, but nope. The choices I had was to look like a jerk and tell the 3 year old kid to move or to suck it up.

The meal was yuck and only choice left for me by the time the flight attendant worked her way back to row 4 was beef. No veg or kosher options. My meal was identical to the one my friends had in economy. Seat 4E barely reclined So I am not sure what my business bump up actually accomplished.

Both flights included a brief layover in Panama City. We also booked flights from Quito to Lima (Booking No. SP6MHI, Flights CM158 and CM337). This flight also included a brief layover in Panama City. The scheduled itinerary would've had us fly from Quito to Panama City, then from Panama City to Lima, then from Lima back to Panama City, then Panama City to Atlanta. It occurred to us that the flights from Panama City to Lima and Lima back to Panama City might be able to be skipped, so when we entered the Quito airport we spoke with a Copa Airlines desk agent about that possibility. She worked on the computer with another agent for about 15 minutes and printed our boarding passes only for Quito to Panama city and assured us that we could stay the night in Panama City and board our flight from Panama City to Atlanta in the morning. We stayed the night in Panama City as planned but when we arrived in Panama City airport this morning to board our flight to Atlanta, we were shocked to find that because we didn't board the flight from Lima to Panama City our tickets from Panama City to Atlanta had been cancelled. We had been given assurances by Copa representatives in the Quito airport the previous day that this would not happen. We spent about an hour talking with Copa representatives in Panama City about this but they were unwilling to help or honor the assurance that we were given in Quito. We were forced to pay a $535 penalty fee to re-instate our cancelled tickets to Atlanta. This is frustrating in the extreme and totally unacceptable given that we sought and were given permission and assurances in Quito that everything was in order",1,1,1,Not specified,Copa Airlines

We asked for help before the flight and when we got into Panamá, both times we were met with ""No"". We finally got to our gate and had to go through yet another security checkpoint, even though we just had a lay over. So they asked for my green card for no reason. They were rude and yelled at us. After that my kids were hungry and thirsty. So my husband when to go use the restroom and buy some food and drinks for us. When he came back the lady told us we couldn't have food and drinks in the gate area. So my husband called us to the side of the gate area and tried to give my and my kids a drink and the lady yelled at us and said they can't drink it inside the gate area.  The lady was standing there watching us. Like WTH. So my kids went out with my husband and I had to stay with the bags. Then when we got to the US our stroller was destroyed. The handle pad ripped, the cloth stained from grease and the sun visor broken. We tried to file a claim with Copa but they just brushed us off. It looks like garbage now.

They alleged that my carry-on was over-sized, and that my duty-free was not a personal item. They threatened me with no letting me board my next flight and they confiscated my duty free even though other passengers offered to carry it for me. They also measured my luggage in the measurement box they have at the gate, and even though it fit in it and it complies with the requirements, they insisted I needed to check it. No one in the ground on in the aircraft offered any support and directed me to reach out to their customer service but didn't help resolve the incident. The duty free is still confiscated. However, senior administrative personnel from Copa airlines contacted me to process the return of my duty-free purchase. He apologized for the miss-treatment and indicated they will conduct some training as he saw the video captured by their own cameras at the gate and agreed that it has been disrespectful. Because of that I'm rating them with a 5. On my way back, while in line to the security check point at the gate, I was finishing the last sip of a bottle of water. The woman at the check point rudely yelled at me, and even though I politely responded, finished my water, threw the bottle in the respective can, she continued to rave. She went as far as to abruptly hiding her badge so I would not see her identification. when I retrieved my phone to take a photo her coworkers and her threatened me again with not letting me board the plane. I encouraged them to be aware of the cameras and told them I was already in touch with a customer person at Copa Airline given a similar behavior on my previous flight connecting through Tocumen as I was explaining, they decided to turn and walk away letting me stand alone as I was still speaking.

Instead of scrimping and cutting incessantly, why not think the other way around and put another $10 on the J ticket? That might fund a little bit more tuna and turn the rolls into an actual sandwich, it might fund the return of pillows and a dinner roll, slightly larger dinner portion, maybe more carefully prepared, a real wineglass and a few more lettuce leaves in the mini salad?

I've flown COPA before with decent experiences. Our outbound flight departed on time, but experienced mechanical difficulties on the tarmac and returned to the terminal. Outbound flight was then cancelled. After a ridiculously long wait because only one staff member seemed to be available to rebook, we were rebooked on a United flight to Trinidad the following day. Annoying, but I understand mechanical difficulties and the need to be cautious about them. After our arrival in Trinidad, we heard nothing for a week. Ominously, there was no reminder to check in 24 hours before departure. The website said to call Copa so we did, only to find that our booking but not the flight had been cancelled. Seems that COPA's IT system is too incompetent to understand that a passenger rerouted on another airline because of a COPA failure has arrived at destination. We were offered miserable options. 2 people could go on the scheduled flight, but the remaining four would have to wait for a day. Later that day, it became clear from Kayak that more seats were available on our original flight at 4am the following morning. I called to request that all of us be put on our original flight. The representative insisted that any change to our original flights would require a change fee of $75 per person. And, in the end, he claimed there were no seats anyway. To deal with this, my entire party of six (including a five and a seven year old) went to the airport at POS at Midnight for the 4am flight. We were put at the bottom of the standby priority list (which COPA said didn't exist/wasn't available) and were given the last seats, after many other standbys had been given seats. We had to run to get the flight. What sort of an airline cancels your booking because its system is so incompetent that it doesn't recognize that you flew outbound on the flight it booked for you after it cancelled your outbound flight? And then cancels your return booking? And then demands $75 per person to get back onto the flights it had cancelled in error from under your feet? Such a waste as other important things, like plane quality and service were OK.

810911,2022-10-24,E Shear,True,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Panama to Medellín,October 2022,2,4,1,2,no,absolutely shameful and disgraceful,"I'll start by saying I really want to like Copa. The staff is really friendly at airports and on board, and they have a wonderful new terminal at PTY now operational. Unfortunately Copa has a unique ability to fail to think through their processes related to the new terminal and completely ruin the passenger experience as a result. They've completely snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, and my experience which I'll relay here is nothing short of Orwellian and bizarre. Having had several subpar experiences at the old terminal (T1), I was really looking forward to using the new terminal (T2) on this trip PTY-MDE-PTY. The outbound flight from PTY was a wonderful opportunity to experience it - the terminal is spacious, clean, modern and efficient - everything that the old terminal isn't. Everything worked well from check in to security, passport control and boarding and I was impressed. All Copa flights depart from the new terminal and everything functioned well. I should've cautioned my enthusiasm after my departure experience as I had no idea what awaited me on my return. On the MDE-PTY return for some odd reason that nobody could explain the Copa arrivals came into the old terminal, which struck me as odd. Why would you build a beautiful new terminal and not use it for all of your flights. Be that as it may, the flight arrived at the old terminal, and I went down to passport control and got through quickly but when I wound up in baggage claim to collect my bag I was astounded to hear that the Copa bags are all delivered to the new terminal. So there I was through passport control and in baggage claim and learned I was in the wrong place. I had to exit baggage claim, make my way to the new terminal via a severely under air-conditioned bus or walk in 30 degree heat and rain. I finally got to T2 but because the baggage claim area is secure, it was not possible to freely enter to collect my bag. Airport personnel insisted I solicit help from Copa to get me inside to get my bag. I spoke with about 6 different Copa employees and spent approximately 30 minutes gaining access. The Copa employees were helpful but not terribly sympathetic. They told me it was totally my fault (blame the customer) that I didn't know the bags were to be delivered and collected at T2 despite a T1 arrival. In my defense I heard no announcement on board, was sent no notification via email or text, was told nothing about this when I checked in for the flight, was given no piece of paper that explained this in Spanish or English, there were no Copa employees who met the plane at the old terminal to advise us to stay airside to go to T2 to collect our bags, and nobody in passport control or baggage claim to explain, no screens advising. In short there was no communication on behalf of the airline to assist passengers. Logically any passenger who arrives in one terminal would expect their bag to arrive in the same terminal. This logic was completely lost on all airport and airline personnel as I tried to collect my bag. I simply cannot understand nor accept that the airline and airport are not at fault by choosing to build a new terminal then not use it, force passengers to walk 1 km in the heat to collect their bags at another terminal and then implementing a a scheme that provides zero information about this to passengers at any stage in the process.

Also, their stupid site can have programs in place to notify of seat issues when choosing seats for kids. This ruined my experience by 80%.

Our flight was delayed 4 hours in Punta Cana due to Hurricane Fiona which was totally acceptable. I would not want to fly in bad weather so this decision was well respected and appreciated. The real issue came with the lying staff that works at the airport. I was told in the airport that our connecting flight in Panama to Miami will also be delayed so that we can make it to Miami same day. They proceeded to say that because it is weather related Copa works well with their customers and makes arrangements to delay connecting flights if needed. We were assured that we would get home same day. I traveled with my husband and three minor children, 10 yrs old, 6 yrs old, and 4 months old. We checked in our luggage, including the infants stroller, straight to Miami. Well upon arrival in Panama we were instructed to make huge lines to speak to Copa staff at the counter. Upon seeing this and carrying my baby I walked to the front of the line and spoke to the Supervisor, and asked for assistance since I had a 4 month. Well the supervisor was clearly frustrated and in a bad mood and took that out on me and my family. She told me to look behind at the line and that I needed to make the line. Well I told her that I take priority because of the baby as it had been the entire vacation while traveling. She told me to sit down that she would be with me whenever she could. About 15 minutes went by, me standing there with my 4 month old baby, and she never once looked my way nor did she assist. Finally the other staff member next to her called me over. We then were hit with the surprise that their were no other flights leaving that night and that we would be leaving the next day. At this time I asked for a hotel stay and she responded ""Copa doesn't cover hotel stay due to weather delays"". At this point I was livid. After paying $1800 for our flights, checking in our bags and stroller to Miami because of incompetent staff, standing at 11pm in the Panama airport with no clothes, no baby food, no diapers, nothing, and being told ""we needed to figure it out on our own"" is plain disrespectful. I then wrote a complaint to Copa via email and spoke to  Customer Service, which did absolutely nothing despite the awful experience and treatment that I received with my family.  I will never fly Copa again.",1,1,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Their customer service is terrible. Prior to my departure they “ran out of luggage space onboard the plane” and claim even though I purchased a carryon bag I had to pay a check bag fee so they can throw my carry on under the plane. I ask them if I can place the bag under the seat because it’s small enough to fit. They of course refuse! I was force to pay the fee and throw my bag under. Upon claim my luggage at my destination I discovered my bag was damage! I took pictures and filed a claim with the airline. I even provided them with the recipe showing date of purchase and amount. This was brand new LV bag. The emailed me back a few weeks later stating the would not cover the damaged “due to the fact that the damage presented may be due to inherent use or quality of the baggage.” This was a brand new LV bag, that I purchase a month prior to the trip. I never used it as a checked bag because it’s small enough to fit in the carry on slot.

803730,2022-09-16,S Hamer,True,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Los Angeles via Panama City,September 2022,2,4,1,2,no,Avoid if you can,"Leaving from San Jose to Panama City, my flight was delayed. There was much confusion and delay in updating the screens of letting the passengers know, they didn't have any satisfying or complete answers concerning any of us being able to get help in Panama with our missed layover to LAX. The flight crew in the cabin did admirably and only gave other passengers seemingly trivial problems. From Panama City to LAX, we had to wait hours after flying in to Panama before even knowing if we'd have flights or where people would be going before reaching their destination. The ground service was laughable, it was one man trying his best albeit not even close to being able to handle the situation with another service member focused on the next flight for the area & sometimes both of them were preoccupied with making announcements or just repeating details to passengers instead of helping us with our issue of being delayed, take that as you will. Others were upset that they would not even adhere to their policies and just intended to let people out to dry due to delays. They were not taking any responsibility for the situation, would not put people up in hotels anymore or give them shuttles or any similar accommodation because as I was told, this was ceased since Covid and that's part of their new restrictions (Allow people to just congest the airport due to delays while also having all over the airport you can't sit or lay down on carpet due to Covid Safety Guidelines) It was so contradicting and beyond that they charged for wifi past 30m unless you paid to stay in an overpriced lounge for 8 hours that I heard from a lady you couldn't even sleep in and they'd keep waking you up to prevent it. Those last two parts are more on the airport than airline but the entire thing was a grossly obvious shakedown. Copa is just aiding and abetting by stranding passengers there instead of helping them. All that being considered, after waiting for hours, I talked to a man that while he gave me questionable reasons for why they couldn't do much and aren't responsible nor had anything else to do than the bare minimum, I was not worried about these other issues as much, I was quite happy he was able to give me a boarding pass for the following morning for my next 2 connections ( I was going from SJO to Panama City to LAX and had my last layover there before finally one additional flight that was with another airline fortunately! ) and he checked all the other flights at my behest to see if I could find something faster or more reasonable. There wasn't but I appreciated the effort and in the SPECIFIC time frame I was talking to him, the speed of getting me what I needed and answering my questions, though I was prepared. All in all, they acted in a way that the idea of a delay was foreign to them, they didn't have any standard procedures to handle it, they had NO sufficient answers and generally no answers to your questions unless you knew what to ask. Be it about luggage, flights, where to stay or what to do. They gave no thought to our situation besides getting us on the next available flight. In my case I had been up for a very long time and was hellbent on getting to the US so I didn't have much in terms of complaints and found the bare minimum acceptable in my case but I sympathized with all the others that got completely f'd over.

On its arrival, I was asked to make a list of every single thing in the suitcase and list its price (mind you that it was clothes I had worn for years and bed linens, school notes, and other personal effects). These people along with the Customs department blatantly scam people. They claimed the Tact Rate in the Air Waybill was how much I had to pay them, yet it is common knowledge for customs people that this is an arbitrary cost used by freight companies and not the actual shipment costs. For reference, the tact rate was $580, while the amount I had actually paid to send the package was CAD$360. In addition, they insisted on us having to hire a customs broker and on having to pay an arbitrary amount to get it out, basically a bribe, but a bribe you can't get away of.

They had not sent me the form I needed in the initial email and had I not called I would have never known about said document. When we took our dog to Copa Cargo in San Francisco they did not want to accept said document because it had been printed out by our vet and was not an original copy mailed to us, even tho the USDA website clearly states that a completed signed document can be printed by our vet and accepted. We finally got that figured out and they accepted the printed copy because turns out they were wrong and it was allowed to accept that one. Well then in Panamá on our layover we tried to inquire about the well-being of our dog after the flight and we were told at the Copa Service Center that they did not handle that type of thing and that we had to talk to another department. They didn’t even have a phone number or contact for that department tho! The woman at Copa Service Center was no help at all and didn’t take my concerns about my dog seriously. We were fed up and exhausted by this point but it got worse. When we finally landed in Medellin we were not informed about the process of what is needed to successfully and accurately check out our dog from Copa Cargo so we spent an additional 4 hours driving back and fourth from the airport to their cargo building trying to figure out everything that we needed to get our dog.

However, upon boarding, Cabin Crew were generous with their offerings of pre-flight drinks. Throughout the flight, Cabin Crew were always available. Business Class seats are fully lie-flat, and with the blanket/comforter and pillow they provide, it was very easy to go to sleep after eating the (rather small) dinner. I suggest having a substantial meal prior to boarding this 7+ hour flight. Before landing, breakfast consisted of pancakes, apple and orange slices, yogurt, cereal, and coffee. For the price, I believe COPA’s Business Class provides great value. Also, access to COPA’s VIP lounge at PTY airport is a nice amenity with WiFi/internet access, even though the food offerings are very minimal (I left the lounge and had a real meal at the main terminal).

For a 7+ hour flight, the meal service is rather minimal (for dinner at departure: a small ham-and-cheese sandwich, yogurt, granola bar, and a soda drink; for arrival: 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of water), so I suggest having a good meal at the airport before boarding AND bringing some snacks with you, as this is encouraged by COPA’s website.

I tried three times, and the website produced an error message each time. Then I tried to call COPA's customer service line three times to buy the seat; each time I gave up after being on hold more than one hour.

The day of our flight came and everything checked out, we checked in online easily, I love that we got to pick our seats without paying (not many airlines do that nowadays), and when we got to the airport - because we only had carry-ons and already checked in - we were able to go right through security. The two flights we took there left on time, we were served a sandwich on the 5 hour one, and were perfectly good flights! Crew was nice, COVID protocols were followed and we got to our destination on time! I was also shocked we got our own entertainment service in economy class (private TV with movies and games and a USB charger). They also handed out headphones for free (even thou I had some they are the iPhone ones and don’t fit for the TV so they gave me a pair - I’ve been on other airlines where they wanted to charge me $16).

My wife and I flew on Flight CM760 from Lima on Saturday, October 30, connecting with Flight CM422 to Montreal in Panama. None of our luggage was transferred to the connecting flight. The rest of the group that boarded in Lima were also affected. From what I could see, it was at least a dozen passengers. We were not informed at any point that this had occurred. Neither the pilots nor the cabin staff told us anything at any point. Instead, we all wasted time waiting in the baggage pick-up area until the wee hours of the morning to find out for ourselves. At no time did any COPA representative explain to us what had happened. And they still haven’t. It would not have been difficult to inform us during the flight that this had occurred and that our luggage would arrive two days later on the next flight. They had over five hours to say something! But no, they decided to say and do nothing and let us find out for ourselves. It’s not the fact that our luggage was not transferred; it’s the fact that we were not informed by anybody. After several emails, I was informed by the lead baggage department agent in Montreal, “Regarding the situation because the suitcases did not connect on time, the only thing I can tell you is that by Montreal airport laws the flight cannot land after 1 a.m., perhaps that is why they did not have time to place the baggage on the flight.” It's a sad state of affairs if the lead baggage agent doesn’t even know what happened!

After they changed the return flight of our ticket then a few weeks later canceled our flight altogether and pushed it one day, my friend and I were about ready to cancel the flight and get a refund. But after being told that we would have to request a refund and wouldn’t just receive one, we didn’t want to run the risk of them denying our refund and keeping our $700 tickets. AND apparently it would take 6 months for us to even receive an answer regarding our refund. So we decided to go. When we got to the airport, all of the announcements were in Spanish first, check-in was slow, and the employees didn’t seem to know what they were talking about any time you asked a question. After we checked our bags and finally got on the flight, 20 mins into the flight, they announced that we were having technical difficulties with the plane and that they were turning back to JFK. When we got off and I asked what the problem was, they said that they were having engine malfunctions.   So we get off and while we’re walking to the boarding area, we were told that the next plane was “ready to go!” It wasn’t and we waited another 30 mins to board. Meanwhile, my friend and I are worried about missing the connecting flight in Panama to Belize City AND the other flight we have scheduled with another airline from Belize City to San Pedro where our hotel is. But they assure us that it will be fine and we receive an email about how our flight in Panama is delayed, so we are temporarily relieved. But then 10 mins after getting on the plane, an employee comes to us and says “you two are going to Belize? Yea, you’re not going to make it there. The plane in Panama is not waiting for any more passengers, they are leaving.” So we ask if they can just put us on another flight in Panama to Belize and they say “Oh Copa only flies to Belize every 4 days.” So we would be stuck in Panama for 4 days! My friend and I are livid, we get off the plane and demand a refund and our checked bags. After another 10 mins of the employees trying to find us and the other 5 passengers that were also going to Belize another flight (although we’ve made it clear that we want a refund and our checked luggage so we can go home NOW), they tell us and the 5 other passengers that our luggage is on the plane .. that just left to Panama. So we got off the plane but our bags were left on the plane! How did they not take our bags off the plane although 7 passengers in total had to get off because of their mistake! The incompetency was out of this world! I asked about my refund because at this point, we lost our money with the hotel reservation, we lost our money with the next flight from Belize City to San Pedro since we can’t even get to Belize at all now, and we lost the money we spent for Ubers to the airport and the ridiculous amount spent on nasty airport food.

On 12/8 I went to take my fly from SFO (with a layover in Costa Rica) with the info I could gather on my own and my negative C19 test but it’s was impossible, so they booked a flight for us to Costa Rica for the next day through LAX, and even though I was on time to board Copa an hour before departing they made it impossible for us to take the flight because of malfunctioning of their systems and miscommunication, so last night while I got stuck in LAX from 8 pm to 7 am 12/8-12/9 and after waiting until 3 am to talk to someone, I asked for credit and cancel and credit the return flights and this person  told me that I didn’t need to cancel the flights ether the return flight just not to show and I would get a credit, but I didn’t believe her and I realized I was wasting my time talking to her so I’ll have to go to SFO airport and talk to someone else there.

I made an request for refund on their website and they denied it stating that they can only offer me chance to change the ticket until end of 2021.

I used to fly with Avianca, with which I had elite status and a chance of an almost certain upgrade. However, I switched to Copa because of four reasons. Firstly, Avianca became very unreliable; the flights are usually delayed. Second, the immigration in Bogota El Dorado airport - usually, a transit airport for me flying out of Cali - takes ages. Third, the El Dorado Bogota airport often presents heavy delays because of the weather and excessive air traffic (it is a high altitude airport located in the mountains). Fourth, the food became horrible on Avianca. In the case of Copa, none of the above is relevant. All of my flights were on time or arrived earlier. Less than an hour transit in Panama is more than enough: no need to pass through security/immigration check again. I never heard that Panama airport was closed because of the weather.

I asked them who is the bank involved on these types of transfer and they told me different countries but none is the one they sent me on the instructions on the confirmation email. All they do is give me the run around and nobody knows what is happening. On 5 of those 15 calls I was placed on hold and cut-off after 2 minutes, making me have to call again and explain everything all over again to a new representative. This Airline has no respect for people's hard worked money. First on the confirmation email I was never told to email them with the receipt of the transfer. Second, after that was done and they sent me an auto-reply saying in less than 24 hours we are gonna contact you, nobody did. Third, now that same department is telling the representative to tell me about the money not being on their account. What is this? Couldn't they have emailed me and told me that instead of keep me waiting? Bottom line, I do think that they got the money but they are trying to rip me off.",0,0,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Worst and horrible customer service ever from the check in counter desk representatives in San Francisco Airport who work for Copa Air! We arrived airport 5 minute late before their 1 hour departure window and missed the flights. It’s not the fact that we missed the flight that upset me but what happened afterward- the fact that they were absolutely unwilling to assist/advise what the next course of action would be for their customer that drove me to write this review. Because they were unwilling to do anything, we ended up calling COPA customer service rep who said the only person who can change the flight was at the airport counter. After a few minutes of unpleasant conversation with the airport reps at the COPA counter, the counter representative finally said she needed to talk to a manager. The manager would not come to assist us neither. We didn’t want to wait there forever so we ended up booking a new flight with United instead to be able to take a later flight. It’s an example of poor customer service and staff training of COPA Air! We are very disappointed with COPA Airlines.",0,0,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

As a first time visitor to the United States, we had traveled all the way from Malaysia, after almost 16 to 20 hours flight, we were preparing for our next flight. It was at LAX when we were told we couldn't board the flight to Colombia because we did not have a visa. No one had told us or updated us that a Visa was now required as when we bought the flight tickets in March, it wasnt required. Somewhere in April the regulation changed and we weren't informed on this matter in any way whatsoever. In LAX, Copa Airlines only had the check in counter and the small hidden office which can be easily missed by the oversized baggage section. Note that you won't get to talk to anyone besides the manager, who's too busy helping everyone check in even though there's 5 to 6 reps at any given time. So we arrived at LAX at 6pm on 28 May 2019, and was lining up to check in for the 11pm flight to Colombia. When we reached our turn, all they could say was that we didn't have our visa and please step aside, the manager will attend to us in a bit. Knowing that we had to wait, we tried to work out the visa issue via online application. All this while, the manager was busy with checking in passengers. And after a few hours of not being able to do much, I went to approach the manager, and all they had to say was please don't step behind the counter area where only their staffs were allowed, and the manager will be with us shortly. And still waiting, not having had any dinner yet, and no place to stay for the night since we had not booked anything while still waiting for this manager, by then it was already 11:30pm. And we still had to wait for the last few people who missed their flight. By the time we managed to speak to the manager, she said to us, ""what was your problem again?"" All this time all I wanted to know was (1) can our flights be refunded, (2) if not, can we postpone the flights? That was it. And as simple as our questions were, she gave an even simpler answer, ""oh in that case, please call the customer service number, we can't do anything here"". Then we're like in our minds, you couldn't tell us this on the spot when we were waiting for the past 6 hours? The next day we managed to get the visa thing sorted out thankfully by pulling some strings with our Colombian friends on 29 May, we called the customer service number, and asked them to reschedule our flight as we managed to get the visa done. The price to reschedule? Guess what, its the same price as getting a new airline ticket. For 2 person, we had to pay USD1,800. Wow. We returned to Copa Airline counter on 30 May night. This is the best part, when we arrived at the counter, there was a white American and a hispanic lady. The American missed his 2nd flight because his 1st flight was delayed like 6 hours. Thats why he was there, and the manager offered him a complimentary place to stay, and a flight back first thing in the morning with any of the Star Alliance partners. However he kept insisting on getting on an immediate flight back regardless of the service provider, and this manager eventually let up and walked him all the way to American Airlines. Anyways this was like at 12 30am. We are extremely tired already. Eventually the lady manager was seen walking back, but she never came our way but continued walking away elsewhere alone. Eventually I got fed up and just got tickets American Airlines for USD 2500 for 2 person.",0,0,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

After going through immigration and security formalities, I went to gate 12 but found no lounge. I tried to use the airport map touchscreen nearby but it was out of service. I finally went to another lounge and they also told me that it was at gate 12. I walked around the terminal for 45 minutes and then back to gate 12. I noticed then that there were stairs to the basement, though there were no signs anywhere indicating what was down there. The Star Alliance Lounge was there. I walked in and I was one of only 5 people, which indicates to me that others also had trouble finding the lounge. The receptionist told me that they were going to move soon so they had taken down all the signs a long time ago. It would have been proper for Copa to have informed me at check-in of this issue. 2) Boarding flight 118 was also a problem. After the boarding pass check at the gate, there was a huge crowd of passengers that was not moving at all. It took a long time for this to clear and me being in business class made no difference. 3) On board, I checked the entertainment system and its offerings were very poor - worse than in any economy section even that I have flown in the last five years. 4) The seat was uncomfortable. 5) It took almost an hour after take-off for us to be offered any kind of food/snack. We were simply given bottles of water before take-off. Later in the flight, about an hour after the small lunch was served, I asked a flight attendant for a snack. She challenged me on this and said something would be offered in another hour. I have never encountered this attitude on any other airline ever. She finally gave me something but was clearly not happy about it. 6) At the Copa Air lounge in Panama City, there was little food and no vegetarian meals were offered at all - no sandwiches, no salads - nothing other than fruit and oatmeal cookies. Again, I have never experienced this issue in any other airline lounge in the world. 7) Shortly after I boarded flight 470 to Toronto, we were given menus and then asked for our choice for supper. I mentioned that I had ordered a vegetarian meal (I had in fact been given one on the flight from Santiago) and the flight attendant said he had no record of it. I said that I had booked the ticket about two and a half months ago and received veggie meals on every other flight. He said he would go ""confirm."" He came back and said no vegetarian meal was available. I asked what I would be fed instead and he said he didn't know. I asked him again - are you saying you're not going to feed me for 5.5 hours? He didn't answer. I told him that this was unacceptable. Then a second flight attendant came and told me the same thing, and asked if maybe I had ordered a veggie meal for 118 and but not for 470. I asked her, ""why would anyone do that?"" A special meal request is made for the whole flight, not for a single leg. Then a third flight attendant came to me and told me the same things. She finally said they would be able to give me soup and salad if I liked. I said that it wasn't a meal and she said there was nothing she could do. 8) I should note that between the time the first flight attendant told me I would receive no meal and the time we actually left the gate was over 20 minutes. Another Copa employee could have been sent to get me something from one of the airport restaurants. However, no one offered to.",1,1,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Garbage customer service. I am a gold Star Alliance member. Copa doesn't deserve to be in Star Alliance. The first leg of our return trip was delayed due to Copa's fault and we missed our connecting flight. Copa customer service didn't help in any way and offered no compensation. How Copa handled this situation was not professional or correct due to following multiple reasons: In Buenos Aires, Copa representatives assured us that despite the delayed flight, we could still catch our connecting flight in Panama and Copa reps would greet us as soon as we land in Panama in order to direct us to the connecting flight. No such thing happened. We saw no help from Copa in Panama to help us catch our flight. So the representatives in Buenos Aires wrongly informed us. We were again misinformed by Copa representatives this time in Panama while rebooking our missed flight. We were told there was no flight to San Francisco the next day (Monday) so we must wait and leave two days later (Tuesday). But as we learnt 10 minutes after receiving this information, another passenger traveling to San Francisco was rebooked on a flight on Monday because Copa accepted to fly her to Los Angeles first and got a United Airlines ticket from Los Angeles to San Francisco. This passenger wasn't in business class. She told us she could get the flight the next day because she argued more and could speak Spanish. So we were lied and put in a disadvantaged position just because we didn't argue and politely accepted what Copa offered us. At the end we could get to San Francisco after a 40 hour delay. We both missed 2 days of work. Now I can't reach customer service via email or phone. The customer service email given to us is a black hole. My emails are only returned with an auto response. Phone customer service said they can't offer any help. Unbelievably horrible experience with Copa.",2,3,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Copa should not assume that travelers know all these things especially on this old type of airplanes. Arrived to PTY - Picked my baggage and pay for a luggage cart to go through customs after that I could not take the cart to go upstairs to drop off my bags to the COPA domestic counter I have to actually find a gentleman that carried my bags by hand . No signs, no directions, no one from COPA to ask what was next. Waited in line for about one hour, very hot and crowded counter with only one staff assisting in the web checked in counter. I had to asked twice to the staff at the counter where to go next, he seem not very knowledgeable. Return Flight from DAV - I was charged for my baggage and they could not send my bags directly to IAD. I was very frustrated because I did not want to go through what I experienced on my arrival to Panama.The lady at the counter said because my tickets were not purchased together, but I explained that I purchased the tickets at the same day and time. I found with today's electronic age that this simple change could not be made possible, I asked the staff to please call the manager. The ""not too friendly manager"" seems bother by my request and said that I have purchased my tickets separately and this was the policy and since I was flying domestic I needed to pay for my luggage, At this time I told the manager okay even though I think that the entire situation was absurd I will pay but please check my baggage directly to IAD - The manager literally looked at me, say nothing and then she tell the staff to check my baggage through and say nothing to me and walked away as if she was doing me a non desire service, it was very humiliating to beg for an hour. I was the last one entering the plane. Departure from PTY to IAD - the complete COPA terminal gates 1 through  was extremely hot - about 90+ degrees no place to purchase water or cool off and all the belts for fast walking were not working. Even though I did stay in the COPA lounge I walked to the gate one+ hour earlier, but still very uncomfortable unhealthy environment at the gates. Again on this leg the aircraft was dated and no entertainment. The young man that attended was extremely polite and very nice, he really made the difference on my frustration of the whole trip. I purchased upgrades for the complete flight and felt as if I was flying economy (For an international Flight) The business class did not feel as such. I used to fly on COPA all the time until three years ago. I started using Delta or United planes and then go to DAV on AirPanama. After three years I decided to come back to COPA to be even more disappointed.

On the return i arrived at the airport nearly 3 hours before scheduled take off, but had to queue for 2 hours to get to the check in desk. At the desk the Copa operative told me i couldn't fly to Managua because i didn't have a yellow fever inoculation card. I wasn't warned about this when i booked the ticket on the website, and i wasn't warned about this when i checked in at Managua 2 days earlier. The first time that Copa decides to tell me i need a yellow fever inoculation card is when my flight is due to take off in 1 hour's time. The operative told me that it's my responsibility to ensure that i have the necessary documentation to travel. Later the same day i had a flight scheduled from Managua at 1.30pm to Houston USA and then a connecting flight to London UK. After much arguing i was issued a boarding pass as I “could be” in transit at Managua. In September the same year I had to make another journey to Panama, Tuesday 04/09/18 to Thursday 06/09/18. Aware that I needed a yellow fever inoculation card, I asked the CM check in staff at Managua Airport if this was still necessary for us to return to Managua in two days time. They said yes although for my wife, who is currently breast feeding, she is exempt from this. In Panama I paid 100 USD for a yellow fever inoculation. The following day I return to Panama airport to catch my plane to Managua and I’m told I can’t have a boarding pass because my yellow fever card isn’t 10 days old yet!! Again, no mention of this when I checked in at Managua Airport even when I specifically asked about the need for a yellow fever card. My wife and daughter flew to Managua without me and I spent a further 2 days in Panama before acquiring a letter from a doctor about my allergy to eggs thus making me exempt from the yellow fever card requirement. After returning to Managua I wrote a letter of complaint to CM demanding compensation as I believe CM are plainly negligent in this case. The reasonable person would say that the information that CMs employees used to deny me a boarding pass at Panama should have been provided to me by their employees at Managua two days earlier to prevent me from my financial loss. Especially given that I asked their employees at Managua if I would need a yellow fever inoculation card to return two days later. CM eventually acknowledged they are at fault. My claim was for 2 additional nights in a hotel and a partial loss of earnings on one day making a total of 394 USD. I believe my claim was entirely reasonable given the circumstances. However, CMs offer of compensation was for a travel certificate valid for 12 months worth 204USD. Given that I don’t intend to fly with CM any time soon this offer of compensation is virtually worthless. If you are considering flying with Copa Airlines then please read clause 9.1.2.1.1 and 9.1.2.1.2 from the contract of carriage, because it basically says that even if their employees misinform you about your travel requirements it’s your own responsibility anyway. In a recent email to me from Copa Airlines it starts:- “Thank you for choosing Copa Airlines Your opinion is very important to us and helps us provide you with world class services.” I think more appropriate and honest would be:- “Thank you for choosing Copa Airlines Your opinion is of no importance to us and we really couldn’t care less about you.”",1,1,1,Boeing 737 700,Copa Airlines

I was looking for a ticket so my son who is 14 years old. Copa classify the adults category as 12 years or more, so minors older than 12 years can fly by themselves. My son is 14 years old, so their system allowed me to purchase a ticket for him. The flight from Raleigh to DC (one of the connexions) was Copa operated by United airlines, but Copa Airlines in any step of the transaction mentioned any restrictions and they actually just allowed me to buy the ticket knowing it was for a 14 year old boy. After 3 days I received a call from United saying that my son was not going to be allowed to fly by himself if he was not 15 years old or older according to their policies, and that they didn't understand why Copa Airlines allowed me to get this ticket knowing his age and their policies. so they suggested I called Copa Airlines, ask them to cancel the United flight and give me another option for Caleb to go to DC for the connection to Colombia. So I called Copa airlines asking for help on this matter, and I spoke with 3 different representatives plus what they call a ""supervisor"" and heir response was: ""you should have read the ""migratory requirements"" that says that minors of more than 12 years old can flight ONLY in flights operated by Copa, so to cancel the flight with United that you purchased trough our website, you are not only NOT going to receive the refund but you are actually going to have to PAY 360 dollars for the penalties that will be caused by the changes you want to make"""" I was like wow! not only I'm going to have to drive my son to VA, not get a refund for a ticket he is not going to use because Copa Airlines wasn't clear or said anything about this restrictions, but I'm going to have to pay them for the changes? wow! this is serious!! so I read the migratory requirements, because how dare I didn't read the little letters right? Nothing. there was nothing on those requirements that even mention anything about a minor. Then they told me.. oh, what you didn't read were the ""terms and conditions"". So I went and read the Terms and conditions, every single little letter in there and... nothing. So they replied: Oh no! is not the terms and conditions is the ""Transportation contract"" what you didn't read, so I went to find the little link, and saw a 60 pages contract, and on 1 of the clauses, on page 15, they mention this weird clause that if any of you read you will not even understand that what they are saying is that minors older than 12 years old can only flight in airplanes operated by Copa. Seriously? Copa Airlines? you guys are telling me that because I didn't read a 60 pages contract, and a clause that nobody can even understand I'm going to have to pay penalties for a ticket I bought from you guys? when YOUR system allowed me to buy this ticket, when you don't even mention in any step that if the flight wasn't operated by Copa, minors cannot fly without an adult? What really worries me, is how they treat people, and how it seems like they just train people to act like robots that are only repeating a script over and over again instead of really helping the person. They treat people like they are dumb, like ""How could you not read a 60 pages contract"" right? and they give you the same answer over and over again, and there's no way you can talk with a manager or someone who can actually look at the case and be flexible and care about their clients not a stupid protocol.",0,0,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

We made 3 different phone calls and spoke to 3 different staff members to get clarification on their unaccompanied minor policies and the staff seemed very unfamiliar and we got the impression their main concern was to force us to change our $300 tickets for new $2000 tickets. They gave us a hard time regarding the departure flight and when that didn't work they gave us a hard time regarding the return flight. The two points of contention come from their own website: https://www.copaair.com/en/web/us/minors-travelling-alone ""The payment of the unaccompanied minor service can be made 48 hours before the departure of the flight through our Sales Offices and Reservation Center."" According to COPA, the above means we must call 48 hours before and submit the request for unaccompanied minor. We called 24 hrs in advance. The issue here is that the kids are flying in a direct flight. They do not have a companion service. We are dropping them off at the gate and they are being picked up at the gate in their destination, calling 24 hours in advance to provide names, phone numbers, etc. has always been sufficient in the past but now they said we missed our window, we were supposed to call 48 hrs in advance and we need to change our ticket. We called again and the two other staff members did not interpret the rule like that, and said 24 hrs was fine. ""For connecting flights, unaccompanied minor service is not offered if the minor's itinerary includes a flight that is the last flight of the day at the connection point, unless the flight is the only flight of the day."" According to COPA if you are flying direct from Panama to Dulles, this rule applies. We pointed out that this is not a connecting flight, it is a direct flight and the rule should not apply. One of the staff members we spoke to agreed with us, the other 2 said the website was wrong. The point here is that if there is no connecting flight, there is no concern of missing a flight and the kids being stranded in a connecting city. For staff members not to know the difference between a connecting and a direct flight is appalling.",0,0,4,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Copa airlines rebooked our tickets when their partner airline we were flying with was late (we were in the check in line more than an hour before our boarding time with our 2 hour layover - our priority marked luggage also came later than anyone else on our flight). They made us wait in an airport for 24 hours without any vouchers or support and did not tell us they were giving us standby tickets the next day. So we did not have a guaranteed way to get home though we were not informed of this and ended up spending a ton of money for the 24 hours stuck in an airport which could have gone toward us rebooking our flights with another airline. When we got to the next layover, we had standby tickets again (even though we booked this flight months in advance & had assigned seats), and one of us was not allowed on the plane and had to fly with a different airline. During this flight they did not give me a meal as I had booked a vegetarian meal months ahead of time and they didn't pass the information forward when they rebooked our tickets (even though I requested it again at the check in). The entire time they put us through this the COPA representatives did not clearly communicate what was happening and they treated us like it was our fault and we were an inconvenience. They also have not been supportive at all in reimbursing us for our costs or our missed services (ie. Food) and have continued to communicate poorly and treat us with disrespect.

Seat belt signs were left lit for the entirety of all 4 flights even though the rides were smooth. Announcements over the speakers are often unintelligible in English (they’re fine in Spanish, and Flight Attendants can communicate in English in a face-to-face conversation). I was unable to use the web check-in for the return flight at MVD (a Chat agent told me this happens at random), so I had to endure a slow check-in process at the counter; 40 minutes is a long time to wait when you are 15th in line and there are 6 agents behind the counter but only 2 of them are processing passengers. It gets cold in flight, and on some flights you get blankets, on others you get pillows, on others you get both, and sometimes you get neither (so: be prepared and bring your own). The aisle seats (C and D) have much smaller foot space than the other seats. For the PTY - SFO flight, there is a security check at the gate, and you cannot bring your bottled water on board (I like to sip water during the ascent and descent). Now, the good parts. The price was very competitive for a same-day flight I had to get for a family emergency. Check-in and boarding were very smooth at SFO and PTY. The Boeing 737-800 planes were modern, clean, with large overhead bins, and seat-back screens with a decent amount of movies and games. All flights departed and landed on time, and my suitcases arrived at the destination in good shape. The FAs were excellent, always readily available (the few times a call button was pushed, I observed that an FA responded within 1 minute --no kidding!). Seat comfort and meal size were OK for economy (meals were better quality than Avianca’s, which I also flew recently). For my return flights, I decided to pay the extra $50 per segment, to move to an emergency exit row, and it was worth it for each ~7-hour flight. Note, though, that there are 2 over-wing exit rows, and the forward one (row 17 on my plane) has seats that don’t recline, while the rear one (row 18) DOES recline and thus you get the benefit of great leg room and you can recline normally. I’d like to reiterate: the FA's seemed eager to provide professional service, and they are the most memorable face of the airline, so in recognition of their efforts I would recommend Copa to my family and friends.",4,4,0,Boeing 737-800,Copa Airlines

In order to finally get the response from them, 2 months later, I had to provide them with another email.

Well, this passenger was really disappointed, inconvenienced (you can't work on coach trays) and quite angry: We are used to penny pinching in coach, but densifying premium cabins is pinching one penny too many.

The rep informed me that my only other option was to sleep at the airport. Our flight doesn't leave until tomorrow at 9am. It was very clear to me at that moment that the rep has no intention of making things right and is not customer focused and has no idea the inconvenience that the airline has caused us.

A few local people came to talk to the agent at the counter, apparently making a strong point about the delay. The gate agent made a phone call, then somehow the passengers got on the bus again. This time we got on the airplane and it took off eventually, delayed about one hour. The reason I am complaining here is that this whole process was not communicated to the non-Spanish speaking passengers at all. There was a number of tourists from Europe and America on this flight, but we were not told anything in English. We did not know why the flight was delayed, for how long. Even when the passengers got on the bus the second time, we were not told to do so. The non-Spanish speaking passengers just followed other passengers like sheep. No direction, no apology, no electronic information board whatsoever. For an international flight, I think this is totally unacceptable.

In particular, the office in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. My brother, from Brazil, purchased tickets for me and my husband to fly from New Orleans to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The same day, I called Copa Airlines to add my infant son to our reservation. After choosing the option for English and not receiving anyone that spoke the language several times I finally got someone I could somewhat understand. I was told it would cost 10% of the regular ticket and I could pay at the airport. I asked several times if I could pay in advance and was told I could not, I had to pay at the airport. I tried calling back a few weeks later and got the same answer. 24 hours before my flight I checked in online and printed boarding passes for myself and my husband. The morning of 10/19/15, at 5:00am I arrived at the airport with my family for our flight at 7:05am. Because I checked in online we were moved through the ""fast line"". I asked to pay the fee for my son and was told it was no problem. The lady with COPA Airlines took all 3 of our passports and $142.00 in cash and walked away to the back office. In all we waited at the counter for over 2 hours! Most of that time we were completely alone. All other passengers had boarded the plane and all Copa Airline representatives were behind closed doors without telling us what was going on. When someone finally came out at almost 7:00 she took my husband with her through security leaving me and my 1 year old son behind with a very unpleasant and unhelpful man from Copa Airlines who claimed to be the manager. The only explanation we ever received was that their systems were frozen. About 20 minutes later the man made me run through the airport while holding my son to catch the flight. I never received a boarding pass for my son nor did I ever receive a receipt for the fee I paid. I was then yelled at by security because the ""manager"" at Copa Airlines was rushing me through the wrong security line while he still had my passport in his hand. Finally we board the plane and are on our way to Brazil. We land in Panama where no one speaks English and the food at the airport cost triple the average price and we wait for 5 hours with a restless 1 year old. When it is time to board the plane to Brazil the Copa Airlines representative tells us we will have to wait so they can check the system for a boarding pass for my son. Of course, there is no way to check it from the desk we are at so again we are left alone by Copa Airlines. The lady with Copa Airlines returns with a smile to say we can not board this plane without a visa. I ask her to explain and she proceeds to laugh and tell me that we do not have a visa so we can not board the plane to Brazil. We are stuck in Panama for now. I call my brother in Brazil and a manager and Copa Airlines said there is nothing they can do. I ask why Copa Airlines sent us out of the country without the proper documents and they said the Copa Airlines desk in New Orleans made a huge mistake. After another hour or so wait we are told they can send us back home to New Orleans. We wait another 2 hours and take the flight home. When we arrived in New Orleans we had to wait at the gate until the entire plane unloaded to get our stroller. This wait put us at the back of the line for customs, which took forever!

The flight from Panama to Rio de Janeiro (a 7-hour trip) departed Panama 40 minutes late but arrived in Brazil only 5 minutes late.

A light breakfast would be more appropriate, especially since dinner is so light. Boeing 737 is not appropriate for such long trips, since space is very limited and turbulence is strongly felt throught the flight.

Copa is increasing its routes and maybe not giving proper attention to the basics: Restrooms are filthy - even in flights departing from their hub in PTY. Staff are friendly but they have no means to react to situations like a wet seat - what should they have done? Not to mention the quality of the food aboard. Last night on flight CM 701 (Feb 23 2015) our plane had to land in Campinas (VCP) instead of GRU at 8.45pm (time of our supposed arrival to GRU) because the plane was short on fuel (GRU airport had traffic above normal).

Got a mix of older and newer planes for the different legs the newer planes were decent with individual entertainment system but when asking for the infant seat belt and life west we have on all other airlines we taken with our infant (KLM Norwegian SAS) we where told COPA does not supply these. Choose to purchase seat for the infant for the return trip using our FAA approved car seat. When installing the seat the seat belt was not long enough to buckle when asking for the extension seat belt the buckle of the extension seatbelt did not fit the one of the original seat belt had to fasten the carseat using the latch system of the car seat around the back of the seat luckily it was long enough to do this. Definitely not the safest airline to fly with infants or toddlers or for anyone else needing an extension seat belt. Service was frequent and staff was friendly both food quality was the poorest airplane food I have experienced. Would definitely not recommend this airline to anyone traveling with an infant or toddler.,2,3,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Given the ratio of new vs. older equipment it is probable that you will be flying on one of their older planes. Such was the case on my recent journey to South America - LAX-GIG / GRU-LAX. The business class seats were old recliner types much like old first class seat of the 70's-80's. The IFE was past its prime with minimal choices and poor music options. Food service while good was not up to premium class standards. The inflight crew was top notch on all legs of my trip. In short the fare was cheapest business class for my itinerary and the minimal connection times in PTY did not require a sprint to the gate. All flights departed and arrived on time. Would I fly with them again? Possibly so but I might consider paying the extra bucks to fly a carrier that offers a more up-to-date comfortable business class.,4,2,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

The check-in in Havana was friendly and easy. The flight in a newish B737 was comfortable (good seat pitch) and the service was efficient. A snack consisting of an empanada crisps and biscuits was served. The airport at Panama City is a pleasant place to transit though the signage to our remote gate lounge wasn't clear. Seating on the E190 is tighter than on the B737 and there is no in-flight entertainment. A pleasant meal service with drinks was provided but half-way through the flight the crew disappeared (even though the toilet could have done with a cleaning). Both flights operated on time and the luggage came quickly.,4,3,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Despite the COPA advertising that they have new planes in the fleet and a contemporary Business Class they were not part of our experience and when asked what route they might be flying we were told that they only have 10 in the total fleet! The planes we flew on were tired old planes which have been well used and show it with ill fitting lumpy seats and entertainment features that are 20 years out of date. My seat refused to stay upright and continuously slowly moved to the recline position. Meals were very bad and to top it off the menu choices on all our flights were the same! The staff were very friendly and affable and trying to do their best but the product let them down - but the flights were on time. Our conclusion is: that it is just not the quality of Business Class a customer is led to believe is available. For anyone used to flying on Air Canada for instance it is a considerable step down with the only recognizable Business Class feature being the size and colour of the seats. In the future if we have a choice COPA will not be our preference.,1,1,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

This was my second time with this airline and I have to say I really enjoyed travelling with them: modern planes with new interiors and comfy seats professional friendly and smiling crew check-in easy and quick and on time arrivals. I would have rated 9/10 but the food is still a letdown (as it was for my first trip with them back in 2013) the price of my ticket was rather high (actually more expensive then my transatlantic flight with LH) and their hub in Panama City does need some improvement in terms of decent food stores with acceptable pricing.

The movie offering on the two longer flights were Godzilla and the other one's name I can't even remember. Service and food were good but the seats also were lacking.

The one good thing was that the flights were on time. I am a frequent flyer I've flown with many airlines and this was the first time I found airline food (or any other food) utterly inedible.

While 6+ hours per segment in a 737 might seem tight the aircraft is comfortable and the lounger biz seats are not too bad for sleeping. The meals and snacks are ample. The drink runs are frequent. The cabin crew was attentive. The IFE was OK (only 4-5 recent movies). Overall a great experience and the UA MileagePlus bonus miles a huge benefit.

The staff were very friendly and always checking to see if the passengers were comfy enough or if they needed anything else. The food was not that good I know that airplane food is not supposed to be the most gourmet thing there is but this ""sandwich"" didn't have any sauce only a sausage on a hard hot piece of bread - not what I had in mind. Copa Club is really nice in PTY though it's full of people always. I found the cost of the total trip not that expensive actually kind of low with the whole round trip being $571.

A partially owned subsidiary of United manages to charge high fares while providing substandard service. I've flown COPA on half a dozen South American itineraries out of San Juan and it is almost predictable that something untoward will happen. We are used to the indifferent personnel inedible meals second rate ""business"" lounge business-class seats that don't recline and baggage that ""misses"" perfectly legal connections. So we should not have been surprised about our experience on our scheduled flight from Panama City to San Juan yesterday. We were denied boarding due to ""overbooking"" - on a coach leg of an otherwise business class itinerary (there were no business seats available when we booked). The rationale offered by the gate agent (we made the reservation more than a month ago) - you should have known when you couldn't get your seat assignments on line that you were on an overbooked flight! After considerable discussions around the unacceptability of spending a 24 hour period in Panama City we were booked on a supposedly unavailable evening flight to San Juan. So after an additional seven hour layover at the mundane Panama airport cum duty free strip mall we were on our way. Oh and the gate agent upgraded a single seat for each of two bumped couples. The trip was otherwise uneventful. The meal was as expected poor both in business and economy. Bottom line COPA was a better airline before United bought Continental. Despite convenient schedules and relatively new equipment from a passenger experience point of view it does not deserve a three star rating.",2,0,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

It was the experience with the return flight that was very unpleasant. I had purchased my ticket over a month ahead of my flights and had confirmed seat assignments as well as pre-ordered vegetarian meals. I checked in 2.5 hours ahead of my flight in Panama City only to be told that I had been moved to the Standby List. I was given some bizarre explanation that there was bad weather in LA and seats were restricted. After passing security I went to the counter at the gate to see what could be done only to find out that the flight had been grossly overbooked. The agent was not willing to put me on the next outgoing flight (as normally is done automatically when a flight is cancelled or missed). I went through security at the gate and then had to stand in line again to find out if I was going on the flight I had booked or not. Interestingly enough all the people in this line ahead of me and behind me that I talked to were tourists. I eventually made it on the flight but had to find out that my vegetarian meals had been cancelled. One of the flight attendants was nice enough to search around and did find some vegetarian food for me to eat. The staff on board were very helpful and pleasant unfortunately the one at the gate not so much. While things do happen (flights get cancelled re-routed are late) being put on the Standby list for no reason at all despite having a confirmed ticket and seat and being at the airport on time is new to me.

I got to experience their best and their worst. Flying from the States to Central America Copa used their most modern aircraft. Seats were comfortable space was good and the stewards were friendly accommodating and provided excellent service. Individual entertainment screens were located at each seat. Each passenger selected their own mode of entertainment (movies music games or following the flight via a map). Both English and Spanish was offered. Earphones were provided when boarding the plane. Blankets and pillows were waiting on each seat. Very comfortable with a thumbs up for Copa for my 1st experience with them. Returning to the States was a nightmare. Copa used very old outdated aircraft. They needed extensive cosmetic repairs. The flight leaving Costa Rica at least had pleasant stewards. Stewards flying from Panama to the States were not. They did not assist to keep the plane clean on a 6.5 hour flight. If garbage found its way into the aisle they stepped over it each time it was encountered. By the end of the flight the floor was overcome by trash including the bathroom floors. They spoke and understood English when it behoved them to do so. One entertainment screen existed every 3-4 seats. Three movies were shown all in Spanish and all without English subtitles. Earphones were passed out after the first movie started. There was not enough blankets or pillows for the number of passengers. Very uncomfortable environment for a 6.5 hour flight.

I managed to get the emergency exit which made the flight quite comfortable. Happy to get a warm meal not used to that for a similar flight in Europe anymore. Cabin crew just did their job no smiles. I was shocked at the lack of safety checks both at takeoff and landing. The gentleman next to me had a large bag blocking the emergency exit. None of the crew members noticed despite one FA reminding us to read the evacuation instructions they just didn't even look. The same for seatbelts before landing. They did walk down the aisle but didn't bother to look. I've never seen this before. Finally by the end of the flight I went to the rear toilet and took my rubbish to the galley. When I handed it to the FA he gave me a nasty look I should have left it on my tray and have him come pick it up. Disappointed.,4,2,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Return segment from PTY-EWR was with United. The most direct route to Recife from NYC with a Star Alliance Carrier that I could find. For business class the tickets were comparatively cheap. All flights were on 737s which were refurbished. Continental equipment. Business cabin was the same as you would get on a domestic US flight. Seats didn't recline much no foot rests no in seat power and overhead monitors. Vegetarian food options were bad mostly soggy grilled vegetables and tiny portions. They also seem to have barely enough for the people onboard. They also seem to ration the alcohol and don't serve it very willingly. On the PTY-REC flights they serve a snack first instead of a meal. They serve the meal 2 hrs before you land at 11 pm at night. On the flight from REC-PTY they didn't turn on the entertainment system. Overall the airline served a purpose it got me to Recife from NYC in the least amount of time and with Star Alliance but I wouldn't fly them again if I had a choice.,2,1,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Arrived at Panama City Airport 4.5 hours early for our flight. We were told at check-in that we were bumped. Copa routinely overbooks their flights. Apparently passengers who boarded our flight confirmed the flight days earlier. COPA never told us to do that. The gate crew gave us no information. Service desk staff gave us misinformation: they assured us that our luggage would be transferred to the 302 flight and they assured us that we would get our special vegan meals. None of these things happened. COPA not being able to transfer our luggage from the earlier to the later flight meant that we had to wait for our luggage for 3 days after we got home.

Because of that I had no chance to try their Copa Club. Crew was attentive and spoke English very well. Food and drink (red wine) were good. Entertainment was poor on that old 737 800 - no individual screens/choices. For the flight back (MCO-PTY) I got the upgrade on time but the United Club is located at Terminal B-Airside 3 whereas our flight departed from Terminal A-Airside 1.

247407,2013-02-06,J Pomeroy,False,Not specified,Business Class,Not specified,Not specified,3,5,0,3,yes,Copa Airlines customer review,Copa is not my first choice of carriers for flights to Central and South America for several good reasons. Ground personnel are most often rude indifferent and intolerant of individual needs. Many choose not to understand passengers who need assistance in English. I do speak Spanish which is a good thing when checking in because the agents will invariably try to charge you extra baggage fees for oversized or overweight baggage and seldom back down. The airline has a horrible record for on time departures. Onboard don't expect much in the way of amenities the cabin is more akin to a domestic first class cabin. Seats on the 738 fleet are all leather with a comfortable seat pitch and a comfortably wide width. However they are old recliner type seats with only a slight recline - but even that feature is commonly in a state of disrepair. AV equipment on board is very old with some aircraft's still featuring the overhead small TV screens every few rows. Audio choices are very limited when they function. The upside are the inflight crews who are friendly professional and very apologetic about the state of the cabin equipment. Food and drinks are reliably good and the flight deck crews are just as good as the inflight crews. Business class fares are usually a fraction of what the other carriers charge so book it only for the added bonus of extra seat space and check your high expectations at the counter along with your bags - which may or may not arrive with you at your final destination.,4,2,0,Not specified,Copa Airlines

Check-in at SCL was slow due to having to argue about having overweight bag fees waived for a medical device - this was sorted without too much trouble. One issue at SCL both with Copa and in general is the difficulty in finding English-speaking employees and the resulting miscommunications likely contributed to the problem. Boarding was quick aircraft clean and our drink and meal orders were promptly taken. Flight departed SCL and arrived PTY 10 minutes early. Service efficient and friendly. Breakfast offered before arrival at PTY wasn't great. The seating for an international business class product is somewhat lacking more like US domestic first class seat pitch and width was good and certainly better than coach. Simply not what you expect in business class on a 6 hr 40 mins flight. Ground service in PTY is where Copa shined on this trip. One member of our party has trouble walking long distances and I was concerned at the walk between our arriving gate and our onward gate for a UA flight to IAH. An employee at the Copa lounge went out of her way to make things as easy as possible for him promptly dispatching a wheelchair to our arrival gate taking him to a competitor airline's lounge because the elevator at Copa's lounge was broken and then getting him to our onward gate in time for our flight.

Overall I think their service is consistent with 3 stars; they're the United of Panama. I'll fly them again if I have to and only when they offer the lowest fare. One thing that really turned me off was that they didn't hold the connecting flight for late arriving passengers delayed due to bad weather in Chicago. We took off 1.5 hours late from Chicago. When I arrived I was greeted at the end of the jet bridge by a staff member already holding a new boarding pass for me. They put me on the next flight 6 hours later. They could have and should have held that flight for 10 minutes for me and other passengers connecting to Brazil. Seat pitch is very tight but that's expected for a 3-star airlines and on a B737. Their turnaround time on the ground was so short that I don't think their cleaning staff had enough time to clean thoroughly. As a result seat pockets still have trash in them. Equipment shows sign of ageing even though they claim to have one of the youngest fleets; I flew on a B737-800. Hot meals were served (all of my flights were over 5 hours) but portion was tiny. Typically airlines food. Dessert was a cookie. On the way back the meal choices were exactly the same no variation between routes. It looks like either chicken with rice or spaghetti with beef whenever you get on a COPA flight. I did notice that their alcoholic choices were better than on United. One thing they were free. Another thing is you could get more variety: red white whiskey vodka and rum. FAs were very average in their service. I asked for tea but the FA completely forgot. Another time I asked for water but my request was also forgotten. They were clearly overworked. Only 3 FAs serving a full economy section with meal and drink service.

Overall fairly positive experience but very expensive at $800. Aircraft in Trinidad was a new Embraer and while roomy and comfortable - we had exit row seats - the most noticeable feature was how cold the plane was. Given that it was 30+ degrees outside this seemed a bit ridiculous. I mentioned it to one of the crew and was given a blanket promptly. One of our party was told in Port of Spain that 'due to a computer issue in Panama' one of our travel party - who had been unable to check in online - would have to have a standby boarding pass for the connection to Lima but that she would definitely be able to travel on the flight. This was not true. In actual fact the flight was massively oversold and the airline had suspended check in that morning. If we had done as we were told and wait there is no way she would have boarded and she would have been stranded for 2 days like many other passengers were. We were lucky. The second flight was of course full but the crew worked hard and food/drinks were fine as was the IFE on overhead screens.

If you have a carefully planned trip do not fly with Flybondi as they will change your flight times and change which airport you fly to with just a couple of hours notice, making it impossible to make any airb&b that you have already paid for, car reservations etc. We had three flights booked with them and they changed the times and destination airport of every single one of them multiple times. We booked a flight from Jujuy to Buenos Aires then from that same airport with a couple of hours waiting from Buenos Aires to Iguazú. They changed the airport we were landing to another airport and delayed the flight time so it would make it impossible to catch the next flight. When we tried to complain they refused to refund us our ticket or provide transportation and insisted we had to buy another ticket for the evening flight out. Meaning missing all the activities we had planned for that day. Hours before they changed also the next flight and again the other one so they eventually offered a transfer from one airport to another, by this time we had already spent extra 70.000 pesos in between first row seats and private transport to ensure our fast exit. When we finally got to the second flight with the transfer provided our seats had been given to priority passengers without us being informed and they wanted to charge us extra for taking the carry on on the plane even the previous flight despite being told by the personnel at the previous airport that we could take it on. We were allowed to take it with us because we had recorded the staff saying this so their hands were tied (good tip for those traveling. Record your conversations if you are unsure) Then when trying to fly out of Iguazu they changed the airport we were flying into again and change our flight arrival time twice. Resulting in a 5 hour delay meaning we would land at 1am so no one could let us into our airb&b. They are an absolute scam of an airline who are just out to rob you of your money. Never fly with them no matter how good you think the price is and it will end up costing you more money in the long run",1,1,1,Not specified,Flybondi

892196,2024-04-01,S Marcena,True,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Belo Horizonte to Sao Paulo,March 2024,3,1,1,1,no,"Dear Gol, never again","Absolutely the worst airline ever taken, for rudeness, incompetence and superficiality. We start from check in: online, it doesn't work! Oh well, we'll do it at the airport. The day of departure arrives, there are a lot of people who have to leave and they spread us out across several lines... It's a shame that in some of these, the relevant counters for check-in/boarding of suitcases are closed. The other lines flow, like time, but ours doesn't. Nobody does anything. Someone complains to Gol officials who pass by because they risk missing their flight and the answer is always the same ""yes, yes, now we'll intervene"", but nothing! Finally, after 40 minutes of standing still, someone deigns to work. The process begins and finally it's our turn. Unfortunately on the other side we find a blonde lady, both incompetent and unpleasant. Maybe it was because working over Easter was weighing on her, but you can't have a similar, grumpy and irritating attitude. He asks (rightly) for the documents and after a few seconds he stops because my wife, a Brazilian with a residence permit for Italy (which incidentally, she will receive citizenship the day after our arrival in Italy), does not have a return ticket in Brazil. Return? In Brazil? We explain to her that we were here on holiday and this is the flight (one of 3) returning to Italy, where we live, work and live. The operator is not, she is not convinced and needs to find out more. My wife's residence permit is given to her, but as I expected, she understands nothing about it. He reads, rereads, looks at the front, looks at the back but nothing, he doesn't understand. She gets up, goes to talk to someone who probably understands something more about her and then returns calmly and says: ok, fine (as if she were making a concession to us). The ticket includes 2 suitcases each weighing 23kg. We arrange them one after the other: the first 20kg, the second and third about 15kg, the last 25kg. The blonde stops everything again, because the maximum is 23kg. Let's try to tell her that no one had ever given us any problems, neither for Brazil nor for other destinations, for similar cases. Only one of the 4 suitcases exceeded 23kg while the others were well below, but nothing, he is adamant. If we don't distribute the excess weight into another piece of baggage, we will have to pay for the excess! And then everything stops again, the people behind us wait and we are forced to open the offending suitcase, take some clothes, transfer them to another piece of luggage and start all over again. Doubly absurd because if we had paid, the suitcase could have remained as it was, so it was clear that the extra 2 kg did not constitute any problem, but that's how it is. And again, we kindly ask her if she can sit next to us and she nods very annoyed. As if we were asking her something absurd. And what does he do? He assigns us 2 central seats, 31E and 32E, on two different rows. We look at each other and let it go, they are probably the only places available. We get on the plane and only after finishing the boarding operations, we notice that the window seat, next to mine (31E), 31F, is free. It's the wrong company, there's nothing else to say! It's the exact opposite of Azul, where everyone is competent, available, smiling. There is no comparison. Dear Gol, never again.  In assoluto la peggior compagnia aerea mai presa, per scortesia, incompetenza e superficialità. Si parte dal check in: on line, non funziona! Vabbè, lo faremo in aeroporto. Arriva il giorno della partenza, c'è moltissima gente che deve partire e ci distribuiscono su più file... Peccato che in corrispondenza di alcune di queste, i relativi sportelli per check in/ imbarco valigie, sono chiusi. Le altre file scorrono, come il tempo del resto, la nostra no. Nessuno fa nulla. Qualcuno si lamenta con funzionari Gol che passano davanti poiché rischia di perdere il volo e la risposta è sempre la stessa ""si, si, ora interveniamo"", ma nulla! Finalmente, dopo 40 minuti a fila ferma, qualcuno si degna di lavorare. Inizia la trafila e finalmente tocca a noi. Purtroppo dall'altra parte troviamo una signora bionda, con  e tanto incompetente quanto antipatica. Sarà che le stava pesando lavorare di Pasqua, ma non si può avere un atteggiamento simile, scontroso e irritante. Chiede (giustamente) i documenti e dopo pochi secondi si blocca perché mia moglie, brasiliana con permesso di soggiorno per l'Italia (che per inciso, la cittadinanza la riceverà il giorno dopo il nostro arrivo in Italia), non ha il biglietto di ritorno in Brasile. Ritorno? In Brasile? Le spieghiamo che siamo stati qui in vacanza e questo è il volo (uno dei 3) di ritorno in Italia, dove abitiamo, lavoriamo, viviamo. L'operatrice no, non è convinta e deve approfondire. Le viene consegnato il permesso di soggiorno di mia moglie, ma come prevedevo, non ne capisce nulla. Legge, rilegge, guarda il fronte, osserva il retro ma nulla, non comprende. Si alza, va a parlare con chi, probabilmente, capisce qualcosa in più di lei e poi ritorna, con calma e dice: ok, va bene (come se ci stesse facendo una concessione). Il biglietto comprende 2 valigie a testa da 23kg l'una. Le disponiamo una dietro l'altra: la prima 20kg, la seconda e la terza circa 15kg, l'ultima 25kg. La bionda, blocca tutto di nuovo, perché il massimo è 23kg. Proviamo a dirle che nessuno ci aveva mai fatto problemi, né per il Brasile né per altre destinazioni, per casi simili. Una sola delle 4 valigie superava i 23kg mentre le altre erano ampiamente al di sotto, ma niente, è irremovibile. Se non distribuiamo il peso eccedente in un altro bagaglio, dovremo pagare l'eccedenza! E allora blocca tutto di nuovo, la gente dietro di noi aspetta e noi siamo costretti ad aprire la valigia incriminata, prendere qualche vestito, trasferirlo in un altro bagaglio e ricominciare tutto da capo.  Assurdo doppiamente perché se avessimo pagato, la valigia sarebbe potuta rimanere così come era, per cui era chiaro che i 2 kg in più non costituivano alcun problema, ma tant'è. E ancora, Le chiediamo gentilmente se può metterci vicino e annuisce molto scocciata. Come se le stessimo chiedendo una cosa assurda. E cosa fa? Ci assegna 2 posti centrali, 31E e 32E, su due file diverse. Ci guardiamo e lasciamo perdere, probabilmente sono gli unici posti disponibili. Saliamo in aereo e solo dopo aver terminato le operazioni di imbarco, abbiamo modo di notare che il posto finestrino, accanto al mio (31E), il 31F, è libero. È la compagnia sbagliata, non c'è altro da aggiungere! È l'esatto contrario della Azul, dove tutti sono competenti disponibili, sorridenti. Non c'è paragone.

Because of this I missed my flight to South Africa. The following day I checked with a doctor at Argentina's ministry of health who agreed my shot card was perfectly valid, legible, and the airline is wrong. I tried to file a complaint with the airline but they refuse to help, at first denied the incident ever took place, tried to cover it up by claiming I was a no-show, and are still claiming a handwritten numerical date is too difficult to read and refuse to refund me for their mistake.

No priority check in could be found and GOL staff were rude and unhelpful. After 30 minute wait we reached check in. Our bags were processed and both were 24kg. The normal allowance is 21kg but increased to 32kg for premium passengers. We were given a slip and informed to take to payment desk to pay excess baggage charges. We explained we were not due any charges as we had a 32kg allowance, this took 30 minutes to sort out with lots of aggressive attitude towards us. Once through the check in ordeal we thought we would relax in the lounge. Wrong, on enquiring about location of the lounge we were laughed at by GOL staff and told no lounge, unlike the GOL advertised facilities.

This was all thanks to the cabin crew who had a bad attitude. Our check in was a simple process with no hidden extra's thrown at us. In other words, no pre-print out boarding pass or pre check in was required before arriving at the counter like one or two other low cost carriers so we didn't have to pay a fine for not doing that. The flight was on time. Our route consisted of two legs, Belem, Forataleza and finally Recife. We managed to get some rest as lights were dimmed early after to take-off and the cabin crew didn't disturb us with many announcements. So far we were happy with the low cost. However on the second leg there was a crew change whilst we were on board. This I believe is normal practise with many airlines, however generally an announcement is made about it in some form or another. The moment the new cabin crew arrived, they immediately made the aircraft cooler to the point that it became very uncomfortable. A fair portion of the passengers asked (including my girlfriend and I) the cabin crew to make it warmer again. They said it would be done but never did. So after take-off, pasengers started using the call button to get it warmer and again nothing was done. When we finally asked one last time they said they would ask the Captain. After that they just kept ignoring the request.

This was a really stressful situation. After our last situation, where we were not checked into both of our flights at the originating airport- this time we were. We were starting to get a bit sketchy as the last time we had flown, we had a 6hr layover and had to collect our bags... The check-in attendant seemed a bit annoyed we were holding everything up wanting to ask all of these questions based on our last travel with GOL. Turns out that it was fine, we got checked into both the 1st flight, as well as the 2nd flight, and that the luggage would in fact be transferred to the connecting flight- that was a relief. This flight, we were going to have 34 minutes on the ground before our connecting flight took off. which essentially means 14 minutes before boarding. So far, other than Rio de Janeiro, all of the airports we had been in had been very miniscule. It was a bit unnerving when at first our plane arrived 30 minutes late into Manaus, then we stayed on the ground for quite a while before taxi'ing to wait longer before finally taking off. I asked a flight attendant to make sure that we would be okay getting to our next flight, and he said that they would wait for us. Well, we landed in Campinas about 15 minutes later than we were supposed to, which means we made some good time - however, when we went to deplane, we found out we were on the tarmac a ways from the terminal - we were taking a bus to the terminal.  We get to the terminal and we follow the signs to connecting flights, and finally get to the terminal and look on a screen as our ticket says we will be going to gate ""---"" Our flight is nowhere to be seen on the Departure list. Talked to a lady at a gate, she said that it was her gate and it we did not miss it it would be in about 10 minutes. Went to restroom, bought some dinner and we were back at the gate. They started calling people up, we went, didnt have right type of ticket, and had to wait till the others boarded the bus before she took our tickets, tore off the stub and allowed us to get on the bus. 2 minutes later she comes outside and tells us to get off the bus (not in English). So we do, and then it is a mad rush following this lady around the airport trying to find the flight we were supposed to be on, which apparently was not the one that we were about to board. We finally get to a gate that has our flight information on the screen (still not on the departure list mind you) and they bring us to the front of the line, the one lady talks to the other and the 2nd starts laughing - we can only imagine that it must have taken off. Thankfully the 1st lady who just keeps saying sorry finally goes to find a flight member that was able to tell us our flight was delayed by 2 hours. Never once during this whole time was our flight ever on the departure list as delayed, or Embarking, or anything at all. As I stated above, horrible customer service. In retrospect, the situation of us almost getting on a flight going probably somewhere else could be found to be extremely funny. However, this is not something you laugh about in front of foreigners that are confused and have absolutely no idea what the 2 of you are yapping about, and all of a sudden we hear laughing - this is nothing shorter than rude, it could have been said later, or away from us.",1,2,0,Not specified,Gol Transportes Aéreos

However staff insisted that we had no choice other than boarding it with the promise that should we miss the connection (which we did) and being that it was a weekly flight the staff at Sao Paulo would be aware of our situation and would have an alternative plan. We landed in Sao only to find that the flight had departed without us and that they had no other plan than suggesting we board the next flight a week later! From then on it was a 3 day nightmare dealing with staff who were not prepared to manage even the simplest situations. After an endless wait at the airport a supervisor came with a ""solution"" a terrible itinerary via Brasilia and Miami staying overnight in Sao.

While the booking process is less torturous than in the past the website is still full of traps that make many people give up in frustration. GOL was once known as Brasil's low-cost airline but prices are now the same as its competitor TAM. The check-in line at GIG was fairly long. The check-in agent was very helpful and allowed me to take a large bag as carry-on instead of checking it to save me the overweight luggage charge. The boarding process was efficient. The aircraft was clean and comfortable. GOL used to serve free beverages and a light snack but on this flight we were handed a menu and all refreshments had to be purchased. I chose a sandwich combo that included a tasteless sandwich a bag of chips and a can of Pepsi for 20 reais (approx US $15.00 a rather steep price for the mediocre quality).

Context clearly implied it was a punitive measure for speaking up and challenging her on her points. Again, I was calm and merely responded to her with my take on the situation. After spending 30 minutes on the phone with Jetstar, it turned out that ground staff were in fact the only ones able to assist and she had flat out lied to get rid of me.

By this stage, I was feeling upset and ganged up on by the staff. There was a queue of people waiting to check in now, and they were all staring at the situation. Continuing to check all the bags in, the staff continued to berate me by telling me I should have booked the 10:10am flight which was direct to Tullamarine!? If I wanted to land in Tulla, I would have booked that flight. My destination Avalon was booked due to it being more convenient and close to my home. I suggested to the staff that they should stop talking at which point the manager came back over to tell me off and imply that I was being unreasonable. I expressed to her that I thought the service I was receiving was abominable and she literally said “I think you’re abominable!” This isn’t even the whole recount of the atrocious treatment I received at the Sunshine Coast yesterday, but I just wanted to make it clear to the public that Jetstar really are a terrible airline with extremely low customer service standards. Following all of this hoo-ha, the staff advised that I needed to go and get a trolley to deliver my oversized baby items to oversized baggage. With a baby strapped to the front of me and a 9 year old also with me, I would have thought some assistance to do this would have been much more productive than getting management to come over and lecture me about reading the fine print when I made the booking.",0,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

897084,2024-05-28,J Lorten,True,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Cairns,May 2024,1,1,1,1,no,bizarre and absurd experience,"The nightmare: grubby money grab at the gate, drunken passengers who kept getting served, and filthy seats. I don't know where to start with our return flights from Sydney to Cairns. From start to finish it was abysmal and put a tarnish on what was an otherwise lovely holiday. I submitted my complaints onboard and via email/livechat after the flights. Jetstar has sent me templated emails that say nothing. Here is what I submitted to them: On the outbound flight from Sydney to Cairns there was a row of three individuals behind us who got so drunk they spilled wine all over themselves and their seats, were constantly shoving our chairs, and raising their voices throughout the flight. The attendants name was X who kept serving them alcohol despite their obvious inebriation. Passengers around them asked them to be quiet to which the group responded with mocking sarcasm. The crew did nothing to address the situation other than serve more alcohol and crack jokes with them. The baggage issue is more complex than just being charged extra for luggage. I'll try to break that down as it was a very unpleasant experience. X was the attendant: Our baggage wasn't weighed in Sydney on the outbound. If Jetstar is going to be militant with the weight (we were 1 kilo over) then it's only fair to weigh baggage on all flights because we would've had the chance to shed baggage with family dropping us at the airport in Sydney. We didn't have that chance in Cairns. As the flight was full we didn't get to weigh our bags in Cairns until the last second because many people were having their bags weighed. This gave us no time or opportunity to change our attire to remove a kilo of luggage which we could've easily done (thinking our bags wouldn't be a problem we wore lighter clothes on the return journey than we did on the outbound). This is Jetstar's responsibility to ensure there's adequate staff to weigh baggage before boarding and to provide time for passengers to decide what to do if they are over weight. Melinda was very aggressive in making us pay $75 and threatened that we would miss our flight if we didn't pay. I could see that the plane was fully boarded so had no chance to dispute the situation which was grossly unfair. This felt like a grubby money grab at the gate. I raised this issue onboard with the crew member who submitted this complaint. They informed me that they agreed with everything I said but said ""don't expect a refund"". They seemed more interested in submitting this complaint because the crew member was tired of dealing with the inconsistency across the Jetstar network when it came to monitoring carry on baggage. Lastly, when we did finally get on the plane, our seats and the floor under us was covered in broken potato chips. It was unpleasant to sit in for 3 hours. But at that point, I'd given up on Jetstar responding in a reasonable way to anything brought forward. I have worked in the travel industry for the last 20 years and have lived, worked, and travelled in over 70 countries. I have never seen such poor service from an airline and been treated with such disrespect. I've flown Sunwing, Ryanair, Wizz Air, and some very sketchy airlines in Asia and Africa. None of them ever hassled me for $75 at the gate for 1 kilo. That was a truly bizarre and absurd experience.",1,1,1,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

From the relentless PA announcements about how the crew should be treated, you'd think we were aboard a magical unicorn, not a plane. I get it, some passengers can be a handful, but did we really need to hear the ""be kind to your crew"" mantra four times during the flight? Speaking of the crew, they might want to consider that their primary role is to assist passengers. I asked for a glass of bottled water to take my heart medication. Her response? ""I can't help you, but you can pay $4.00 or drink tap water."" It wasn't about the four bucks; it was about the complete lack of empathy and urgency, especially when I explained that tap water wasn't an option due to my medical condition. Sure, I'd bring my own water onboard if I could, but thanks to Australian regulations, that's a no-go. For medical reasons, the crew should consider making exceptions or providing assistance.  The crew's customer service skills and smiles were about as rare as a blue moon. Upon landing in Sydney, the baggage ordeal was a two-hour-long spectacle. No announcements, no apologies. They even managed to announce the wrong baggage belt twice before passengers had to play detective to locate their belongings. It was absolute chaos – more circus than a well-oiled operation. The only reason I'm being generous with a 1 and not a 0 is because the aircraft did land safely.

Our flight was delayed in Phuket for 40 hours with 6 time changes, which caused a lot of inconvenience and frustration. We were removed from the plane at 11:30 pm and were taken to a hotel provided by JetStar. We had a 5-month-old baby with us, but unfortunately when we arrived around 1:30am, the hotel did not have any safe sleeping conditions for our child, including a cot. Despite repeated requests, we were denied any proper sleeping arrangements for our child, which made our situation even more difficult. We were unable to book another hotel as we were told that our flight would be delayed for only 8 hours, which kept getting pushed due to issues that were entirely in JetStar's control. Moreover, we found that the information provided on the JetStar website or at the airport was entirely contradictory to the information we received when we spoke to someone online.

Then they lied as we were told the hotel was close to the airport when in fact it was 25km away as I noticed when we were on the bus the driver drove past the area where they told us the hotel was so I asked him where he was going to which he replied ""Phuket town"". If I knew that before I could have gone to my home in Phuket instead and save myself a lot of time. But because they said it was close to the airport I figured there was no point going home. We got there around 3am and aircons blew hot air then got told we would be picked up at 1pm to go to the airport even know the hotel manager stated a late check out was totally fine. We got to the airport before 2pm and check in didn't open until 0340pm and i got told by check in staff the flight might be cancelled again as there were not enough first aid supplies on board and they needed to be flown in. At check in we got a 300baht voucher which was only valid at burger king where meals start around 500baht. The flight got further delayed because aircraft was not ready yet. So I missed a whole day of precious family time whom I hadn't seen for 7.5 years plus spent a lot of money on overpriced airport priced food and drinks. The crew was nice put the plane was dirty as hell. Dust everywhere, drink marks etc. When we landed in Sydney they parked us on a remote stand near cargo and we couldn't disembark because the AFP had to come onboard. After that there were no busses available as Qantas parked an A380 on the bay next to us and those passenger had to be disembarked by bus too. Once through customs I went hunting for Jetstar Australia customer service. A very rude agent told me to go to the office on the 3rd floor, when I got there in was closed and dark. I went back down and asked her why she sent me to a closed office. Then some ladies with Jetstar uniforms where there but apparently they worked for Swissport. The supervisor seemed very cold and had lack of empathy and tried to brush me off and was very condescending.

This absolute bottom of the barrel level of customer service is just shocking. I highly recommend that you do not fly Jetstar.,0,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

When you get to the airport, they say you cannot check bags or must pay $25 per kg! What? I've never heard of such a policy. After some haggling (while worrying we'd miss the flight entirely during this lengthy process) we got the price to $225 for both of our bags, which is still far steeper than the $105 it was supposed to cost (again usually international bags on most airlines are free). We did pay $800 for a ticket after all. Then, on board, you cannot even get water, soft drinks, or coffee without paying a fee. Nothing is free. Plane is cramped.

Read on to understand why. We flew into Auckland Airport, New Zealand on 3.12.22 with the intention to cycle tour around this beautiful country. Unfortunately our hold boxes containing our bicycles and everything else except our hand luggage, did not arrive at the same time. We were left with no option but to hire a car to get to our prepaid accommodation some 60km away. For 4 days we rang and emailed Jetstar. On each occasion we were told that they were still trying to locate our luggage. We were promised on numerous occasions that someone would call us back to give us an update. Annoyingly no call was ever received. With our travel plans totally disrupted, out of sheer frustration, we drove back to Auckland airport to discuss the matter face to face with the lost/delayed baggage department. After queuing for an hour with our angry folk trying to locate their luggage, we finally got to see someone. Eventually, they actually found our boxes whilst we waited. There must of been at least another 6 bike boxes in the lost luggage hall along with literally hundreds of suitcases. Who knows how long we would have been waiting for Jetstar to advise us that they actually had our luggage at Auckland airport. Days possibly weeks we suspect. Ours, is sadly not an isolated incident. Since then, we have sent email after email trying to recover the unbudgeted car hire costs we were forced to spend due to Jetstar’s inabilities.

Given Jetstar has misplaced my bags previously I thought this is better and maybe the plane wasn’t full. No plans was very full and aggressively Charging extra to board (no option to check in so clearly no car re safety of overloaded plane). When I tried to explain I’d wanted to check but counter staff had said it was ok I was rudely told this was my problem to have asked for my bag to be weighed. It was was so aggressive and clearly not for safety (flight boarding late, they would not have offloaded cargo) I do my best to never fly Jetstar.

805448,2022-09-26,G Mailes,True,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Queenstown,August 2022,2,2,1,1,no,Give this airline a miss,"Worst airline I travelled with in in my life. Had a holiday in Queenstown, New Zealand and booked a Scoot flight to Sydney from Singapore, and a Jetstar flight to Queenstown from Sydney. At the start of my trip, I faced no issues entering Sydney with my valid Australian Electronic Travel Authority (ETA), and was promptly cleared by immigration. After which, I took my Jetstar flight to Queenstown, and did not encounter any issue as well. At the end of my Queenstown holiday, I arrived promptly at Queenstown airport to check-in for my Jetstar flight back to Sydney (where I would then take a Scoot flight a couple of hours later from Sydney to my final destination - Singapore). At the Jetstar check-in counter at Queenstown airport, I was asked to present my Australian ETA which I did, and was told by the Jetstar staff that there was an issue with my ETA, because my full name was stated in the Family name field, and told me to apply for a new ETA right then and there. Flabbergasted, (as I had not encountered an issue with my ETA that had allowed me entry into Australia twice before, most recent being the start of my holiday AND my ETA only expired in Mar 2023) I did as I was told and started to apply for a new ETA using the Australian ETA app. As retrieval of passport information via the app is by scanning the chip in the passport, my Full Name auto-populated in the Family name field (and could not be edited). Even on the app, it explicitly said ""For some passport types, the applicant’s given name will appear in the family name field… Please do not rescan the applicant’s passport in these cases as the information is displaying correctly"". I highlighted this to the Jetstar staff and was then told to NOT use the app to apply for a new ETA, and to do via the website instead, which went contrary to what was written on the website ""From 6 April 2022, all ETA-eligible passport holders can now apply for an ETA using the Australian ETA app… At this time, ETA lodgement is only available through the Australian ETA app"". Long story short, as I was not able to reconcile this alleged issue at check-in, the Jetstar staff informed that she would not be able to check me in for my flight, and hence I missed my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, which meant that I also missed my Scoot flight from Sydney back to Singapore. Given that I had to return to Singapore ASAP, I had to spend about SGD$2000 for a one-way last-minute flight ticket back to Singapore from Queenstown, and also spent about SGD$300+ for an unintended additional night's stay in Queenstown given that the next available flight was the next day. Lodged a complaint to Jetstar requesting for an explanation, and was informed that it would take up to 15 days for the Resolutions team to get back to me. 15 days came and gone and I again followed up with Jetstar, who informed that it would take another 5 days to process. 5 days have passed and I have yet to receive any word from Jetstar. Without a response, Jetstar is now impeding my ability to take other necessary actions with other entities that will help me with this monetary loss related to travel disruption. Give this airline a miss. Bad experience and you will end up losing money/ paying for additional costs that would not have arisen had you taken another airline to your destination.",0,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

I waited, she did not come to me to notify me about my bag. Well, I trusted her as a staff and crew member of the flight of Jetstar. Reached Sydney, as I was getting down, I asked her, what happened to my bag, and she said someone from the baggage will page my name for my bag. Well, again I trusted her words and waited at the baggage area, my bag not to be seen, went to check at the Jetstar baggage counter, explained to she and she checked and she gave me a paper with baggage service reference number. I waited more than one hour, looking and waiting for my bag, 2nd I put my trust on the crew member. At last I got a call from the baggage service counter, saying my bag has been sent sent back to the ground at Uluru (Ayers Rock) airport. It is total disgrace to put a passenger in such situation. I had stayed in a hotel having no change of clothes, all were in my bag. I had wasted more than an hour waiting and looking for my bag, caused me stress and anxiety going through all this. I had to go purchase new clothes, new personal items. That bag of mine looked big, but could've easily fit into the cabin bag above the seat.

First thing that went wrong is that our flight from Melbourne to Cairns (JQ940) was cancelled in the middle of the night. So lucky my husband woke up and saw the message, and we spent three hours in the crazy hours of the morning trying to find another flight that would get us to Cairns on the same day. The lack of flight choice without ridiculous stopovers was appalling. And thanks to the airline, we lost an entire day of our trip. But that’s not all. Before we left for our honeymoon, Jetstar told us that our flight home was rescheduled to be earlier. Which was disappointing because we were going to lose another day of our honeymoon. And once again, this morning we received a message in the middle of the night, telling us our flight (JQ941) has been delayed. Well, our hotel front reception weren’t in until 9am to help rearrange a later shuttle bus, so we had to suck it up and head to the airport to wait four hours for our flight. But then, about 10 minutes before our new boarding time, the departures sign showed that our flight would be further delayed by another two hours. So basically, that’s over 6 hours of us dragging around the airport, wasting our time and holiday. I’m currently in Cairns airport as I write this, trying to get back home to Melbourne, really upset. Where’s the communication? No text, no email, the app is all incorrect information. Where’s the staff that we can talk to? And with all the delays put together, it’s literally back to the original flight time we had when we booked. If we had known this earlier than 4am, then we could have spent another day enjoying our honeymoon. All up, I’d say we lost two days worth of our honeymoon, just from Jetstar flight delays and cancellations. I probably will never fly Jetstar again.

(The Jetstar Short haul business class equivalent) the price was reasonable. i was driven to the airport in a private car (not part of Jetstar business class,) there was water and free mints. i arrived at terminal 4 on the way in i found a WHsmith store and bought a Jetstar A320 model plane. once i had checked in I tried to ask a Jetstar staff member about how to acess the food voucher the staff member was rude so i asked another staff member who answered my question. To go to the lounge i had to walk all the way to terminal 1 to find the Qantas lounge. they offered plates of salami and fruit but i went to the hot meal area, I got pasta bolognese and outrageously tiny piece of cake.

My cousin was stopped by the security to check his bag, while I ran to the gate. I arrived there at 10:09 (only 4min after the boarding supposedly started), and the attendants were already pressuring me to enter the flight so they could close the doors and leave my cousin behind. 4 minutes of difference and they push me to leave my cousin behind, completely inhuman behavior.

I was lucky to have gone to bed late and checked my email by coincidence and there it was cancelled flight. You can imagine my disappointment as I have called them twice previously and waited 2.5hrs on the phone to speak to an operator. I thought being 11.45pm I would be waiting only like half an hour but no I waited 1.5hr. No call back facility available. Then I get a lady who was very, very rude. I told her about my disappointment since the first time I called was due to Jetstar having messed up my transfer in a way that I missed my connecting flight. No apologies for having waited so long at 1am in the morning or for the inconvenience of cancelling the flight. So I asked her to see what other flight i could take so i could make my connecting flight to which she says and 11am flight but its through Qantas and yours was through jetstar so you will have to pay the difference. I questioned her on this as i said but Qantas and Jetstar are the one company and you are the ones who cancelled the flight not me. To which she retorted `You were the one who chose Jetstar'. So then after she calculates the difference and i think this is so wrong from all levels of customer service I instead asked for a flight with Jetstar for the Sunday which is a direct flight to my destination (no transfers as I cant trust them to get it right a 3rd time). So my question to Jetstar is why such long waiting time on the phone? Even after midnight? Is the Call centre in Mumbai as only one time out of the 3 times I called I got a clearly spoken customer service agent that resolved my problem swiftly and courteously. Why do you hire Customer service agents who cannot express them selves clearly, have no aptitude or problem solving skills or desire to help the customer. This is terrible for your business as I will not book with Jetstar again to sit in a phone line 2.5hrs average is just unacceptable. Last minute changes and no apologies and rude customer service agents who can't articulate themselves properly, have attitude and down right rude. My biggest gripe is why cant I change these flights online myself? It says you can but when you go to do it it says you must call a customer agent so its a futile process deliberately done to frustrate the customer and beg for something or a service that you have already paid for but will not get.",0,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

The answer is the company don't want to loose money and don't care about their customers. Believe me, the reasons is not Covid19. Instead of giving me a refund, Jetstar just offered me a voucher (still haven't received anything yet). Because it's really important for me to go I decided to pay $300 to go with Air New Zealand. Today is 4th September, and surprise Jetstar cancelled the return flight (we are now on level 2 and Air New Zealand keep their flights going). What do Jetstar want to offer me? Of course one more voucher because they don't want to give me back my money! So now I'm stuck in the South Island and my only option is to go back with Air New Zealand paying an extra $400. So because this company is not serious at all I lose almost $700. If they would like to take care of their customers they will refund straight away the money and plan things in advance.

The flight was late about one hour. We told the counter rep at Melbourne that we needed to catch next flight JQ3 and didn’t have enough time to transfer due to the delay. We asked them to transfer our luggages directly to our next flight because our next flight is also Jetstar. They told us they couldn’t do that. When we got Sydney airport and rushed to Jetstar counter. They charged us $140 for two luggages. We have traveled so many international flights and always have one free checked bag. We were already late due to your delay and took about 20 minutes to check in and pay luggage fee. Fortunately we did catch our next flight from Sydney to Honolulu. When we arrived Honolulu, we found our two luggages missing. We spent one hour to file the paperwork. On 1/31/2020, we got a call from Portland, Oregon International Airport (PDX) Alaska Airline counter on 1/31/2020. They told us that our bags arrived at PDX and asked us to contact Jetstar and make arrangement to pick up (because Jetstar doesn't have any contract with Alaska Airline to deliver missing bags to customers). We discussed options with Jetstar luggage reps several times and spent over three hours on the phone. Finally, they gave us three options: 1. We can go to PDX and pick up the baggage ourselves. 2. Ask Alaska Airline to make arrangement to deliver the baggage. Alaska told us they could not do so since they don't have contract with Jetstar. 3. Arrange a third-party courier to pick up. Jetstar will reimburse cost with any of above options. After we considered the above three options, we decided to pick up the baggage on our own. We live 70 miles from PDX and it takes us about 1.5 hours one way to PDX. We left home at 5:30pm after work and came back at 9:00pm. We spent three hours on the road and half hour at PDX. We have been working the reimbursement with Jetstar since 2/1/2020. They asked us to complete the statutory declaration. We did. After all time we spent, they are only willing to reimburse us mileage cost and no drive time reimbursement. They don’t follow through their commitment.

I understand that flights are set to change, and this is forewarned upon booking but the sheer frequency and drastic shifts are unsettling - especially being so close to the departure dates. I requested a refund, which I was permitted. Then followed up by filing a complaint.

711578,2020-02-02,Alex Warland,True,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Perth,January 2020,3,4,4,5,yes,couldn't have gone better,"Flew Sydney to Melbourne - JQ527, then scheduled to fly to Perth on JQ970 two weeks later. SYD - MEL flight was good, and I can't see myself ever paying extra to fly QF or VA for an hour hop. Everything had to be paid for, but honestly, I didn't mind - you close your eyes and you're there. Seats themselves were not very well padded, but that's to be expected. Legroom was ideal, coming from a semi-tall bloke. Bags came out quickly, had an on-time departure and arrival, service was great. That's to be expected, and from someone who had never flown them before, I felt that what everyone always says about them is misguided - it's a budget airline after all. We took the Skybus from St Kilda to Tullamarine - the last of the day @ 8 pm, so we had to wait around the airport for a bit. However, for a $20.50 fare for two adults (special), the convenience and not having to catch public transport was worth it. Check-in at Tullamarine was easy, as was bag drop, went through security, only to find our flight had been cancelled due to the crew timing out (read - legally worked too long that shift to be able to operate the onward flight) - so, back through the terminal and waiting in a line for help. Thank god we got there when we did, because the queue stretched for ages right after we arrived. The good thing is, it's super easy to change your flight when it's cancelled. We originally changed our flight to a 6:05 am departure with Jetstar, but seeing the provided accommodation was in Preston - a good 45mins away by taxi, we tried to get a better flight - also seeing that people had been able to change to Qantas flights. They are constantly loading more flights and options into the system in the event of a cancellation, so we asked to see if there was anything better they could do for us, and it turns out that there was a Virgin flight the next day leaving at 9AM. This suited us, and we were set. The accommodation they provided was great - fairly modern and gave us meal vouchers to use at the hotel - we used them for breakfast, which was okay, but I would use them for dinner depending on when you need to go there if you're in the same situation. They also reimburse you for any taxi services you need to get to and from the airport - however you need to coordinate this yourself after the journey is done. However, the lady coordinating the giving out of hotels at Tullamarine was rude. Too sassy for her own good, we tried making conversation with her and all she could do was give snarky comments back - when she was literally doing her scheduled job (write people's names down on a list), at her normal shift time. We're the ones being delayed here - you're getting paid. Cut the attitude. However, everyone else at the service desk was friendly, which was good. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Jetstar again given my experience on the first flight, but it's also good knowing they have a good system for cancellations - you're covered even if they're unable to fly. And, for paying $150pp incl bag, getting a free hotel, taxi service, and a widebody Virgin flight the next day with inc food and entertainment was great value for money. Thanks for cancelling my second flight, Jetstar. It couldn't have gone better, for me at least :)",0,0,0,A321 / A320,Jetstar Airways

Our experience with Jetstar Airways on a flight in New Zealand was very disappointing due to the disruption in the flight, the subsequent lack of communication, and the promises of staff that were not supported by corporate. Jetstar experienced a countrywide failure in their computer systems causing manual processing leading to delayed flights. Our flight was delayed over 4 hours causing our connection to the US to be missed. There was no later flight, so an overnight stay was required. There was no communication about status - the flight boards were not updated. In fact the board showed that we had arrived, when in fact we hadn't even left. I was not able to pursue changes with the connecting flight airlines because they showed the flight on time.  Upon arrival in Auckland I was informed we would be transported to a hotel and provide meals. Later I was told the transportation would not be provided but we could take the Skybus and submit expenses for reimbursement. I asked if there was more than one hotel for the brand and was told no. When I got to the Skybus counter, I was asked which of the two hotels for that brand. I went back to the ticket counter to get the specific location, and by the time I returned we had missed the bus. Upon arrival in Auckland there was a long (1km) walk to the hotel. Upon checking out the next day we were advised that the hotel was paid, and a $30 credit for meals was applied. The latter in direct conflict with written policy that it should've been $60 and further that the airport representative stated that would not be limited to $60. Upon return to the airport the next day, there was no one available to handle the reimbursement request so we submitted the request for expense reimbursement online ($167). After waiting over a week past the processing timeline I followed up via chat. At which time I was advised that they would not support reimbursement of any kind despite the statement of staff. No avenue for escalation was provided. I accessed their chat complaint system, uploading all of the original documents supporting the reimbursement request. I was on the chat for 2 and ¼ hrs. and asked redundant questions and then to be advised there is no reimbursement. At one point the individual stated there is no reimbursement when in home city, which was blatantly wrong as it was clear my home city is in the US. Thankfully, Jetstar did arrange and pay for the hotel as they obviously acknowledged the need.

I had booked with confidence as this is a Qantas subsidiary. Arrived at the counter and one has to check in and also tag their own bags. I had no problem once I was able to find a working kiosk and one that was available. The lines were unbelievably long due to most people having no idea how to check in at the kiosk and were dumbfounded with the bag tag. It was mass chaos and no one from JetStar assisting in any way. I had done my research and paid for my extra baggage and carry-ons before arrival. By the time you pay for the extras, believe me, I spent much more than if I just flew Qantas or Virgin. But Jetstar had the flight schedule I needed. Arrived at the gate, weighed my carry-on and the customer service rep tagged my bag. We sat there and sat there. No plane, no announcements. Then about 200 other passengers descended upon our gate. Something was up. No gate agents at the desk. Finally an announcement of a gate change. I move to the new gate. There is a plane. We sit for another 30 minutes, I'm suspect there is a problem as we are scheduled to fly an A321 and an A320 is at the gate, which will not accommodate all the passengers. Suddenly, I watch all of the gate agents pack up and leave. No announcement, nothing. They just walk away and disappear. Again, I get up and walk over to the departures board and see that again we have a new gate. I go back and announce it to those of us sitting at a gate. We all move to the new gate per the board. An announcement was never made of the gate change and passengers were running all over the place, confused, furious - mass chaos. Finally we board. I'm sitting in the first row 1A, extra room seat and I paid the premium for it. I notice that I'm sitting in a wet seat and the carpeting is soaked and squishy. The cabin manager, who is professional, gregarious and superlative in customer service briefs us on operating the emergency exit and then we sit and wait. We sit and we sit. The PA of the plane is not working. The cabin crew notices the water and the wet carpet. Mechanics determine that due to the heavy rains, someone left the door open and the water affected the electrics of the PA system. We sit as they try to fix it. Of course the plane is taken out of service, and our cabin crew is now illegal and we disembark. We gather again in the gate, and remarkably a new plane was promised and delivered. At this point, the gate agents were finally competent and doing their jobs. I have to say I found the cabin crews to be excellent and I felt very safe flying Jet Star. The hassle one experiences at the gate is absurd to say the least. Flying is bad enough on a full service carrier, so why torture yourself with JetStar.

A Jetstar employee notified customers that the flight was delayed by half an hour. 20 minutes later, the same message was repeated meaning the flight had been delayed by an hour. Then I got a notification on my phone saying that the flight wasn’t going to leave until 1650!! This was bad news for me as I had a connecting flight out of Darwin. I then spoke to both Jetstar and Qantas customer services and they couldn’t put me onto another flight combination (even though there were at least 20 seats on two Qantas planes back home, I googled it). The customer service, in my opinion handled it very poorly and only offered me accommodation in Darwin.

I flew with Jetstar for my flight from Hawaii to Australia and then within Australia and to New Zealand. First off, with a kid and a job, a trip to Australia was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. We only had 10 days to make it to both Austalia and New Zealand, Jetstar delayed us in Hawaii for three days, our layover was supposed to be 24 hours. This meant our hotel and activities planned in Australia were just lost money for those days. We finally made it to Sydney (with only 1 day to enjoy because of the delay). From Sydney, we were flying to Melbourne and sure enough, our flight with Jetstar gets delayed, on top of that, my friend gets charged for her backpack that was well within the size restriction. We finally make it to Melbourne, after a few days there we are to fly to New Zealand. We get to the airport in Melbourne and our flight is delayed again. This was by far the most horrible and disappointing experience. I would also like to add that the flight attendants with our flights in Australia were very rude and unreasonable.

I knew this was a budget airline, so I never had any high expectations on it. However, Jetstar is literally the worst budget airline. They have you retrieve your baggage between connection flights and have a super expensive fee for checked baggage! We had a domestic flight from Sapporo to Tokyo and followed by an international flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong with Jetstar. The staff at Sapporo check in counter did not speak a word of English, so when she struggled to tell us that we had to get our luggage and re-check in through their international flight counter in Tokyo, we thought we heard her wrong. Also, they charged us 10,000 yen for 2 luggage bags and measured the dimension of the only carry-on we had.  The domestic flight was late by 30 minutes. Our layover time in Tokyo was supposed to be 1hr 50min. So by the time we got to Tokyo and got our bags, it was already less than an hour before the flight takeoff to Hong Kong. We had to run all the way to their counter and check in our bags again and ran to the gate, just to later on find out the flight to Hong Kong was also delayed. The boarding is always a disaster for them. They have all the passengers lineup for boarding at once and could take almost an hour to finish boarding, no wonder their flight is always late. Staffs were unresponsive and rude.  Due to their delayed flights, we could not have a chance to eat before we got on board, so we wanted to order food off the menu. I tried to call the attendants 3 times that we wanted to order, they kept telling me to wait. My husband said they may only take order with their food trolley which they moved from front to the end cabin. OK! That doesn’t make any sense but alright I will follow their rules and wait, unfortunately we sat at the end of the cabin. So we waited for another hour and the food trolley finally passed by and passed right through us, without stopping and back behind the curtain!! I was like, didn’t I tell them again and again I wanted to order? How could they just ignore us like that? We called one of the attendants back and she goes, “I am sorry, all our food is sold out.” Could anyone tell me what did I miss there? If you want cheap flight, I can tell you this airline isn’t exactly cheap with their high checked baggage cost and extra carry-on cost. The inexperienced and helpless staffs could also cost your vacation mood. I often travel to Japan and Japanese are always well-known of their efficiency and hospitality.

Baggage check in was closed early on a flight that was delayed. Was standing in line for 20 mins watching 5 staff behind the counter mess around doing nothing then telling me I was too late to check in when I finally was able to talk to someone. They claimed I was late to check in and that I should have been earlier however I wasn’t the only one in the queue with this issue. About 3 others were also waiting to check in their baggage to the same flight but staff were not serving people and when they finally did we were blamed as being late when we had been standing in the queue since well before check in was due to close. I was rather frustrated when getting to the counter to find out I would have to wait for another 2 hours on arrival at my destination as my bags couldn’t make it and would be sent on the next flight. I said I was disappointed in the service and would reconsider flying with Jetstar in the future. A Jetstar staff member proceeded to snap back at me claiming she didn’t care whether I flew with Jetstar again or not and that it was my fault I wasn’t here early enough. I work in retail myself for a company that was recently awarded best retailer for customer service in Australia. Jetstar staff definitely have a thing or two to learn.

The very worst flying experience of my life. I read all the horrible reviews and thought, aw c’mon, how bad can they really be? Well, here it is. Booked a non-stop flight from Honolulu to Melbourne scheduled to depart 8AM and arrive about 10-1/2 hours later on October 1st. Arrived at the airport and stood in the check-in line only to find out that the flight was cancelled. No advance notice whatsoever! We were sent away to a hotel shuttle after being assured that we should be rescheduled for the next day and would be notified later in the day in any event. After hearing nothing from Jetstar by early afternoon, we logged into their website to discover that we had been rebooked for 8:30AM on October 5th, connecting through Sydney with a 7-hour layover! So, instead of a direct 10:30 journey, we were now spending 3 nights waiting for a 19-hour journey and all without even the courtesy of a notification. To make matters worse, when my wife and I finally got on the plane, we discovered that we were not even seated together on this wonderful replacement flight and we had paid extra for our seats on the original flight. Plus, it gets even better. Jetstar does not transfer luggage between an international and domestic flight on the same ticket so we needed to collect our bags in Sydney and drag them around the airport with us for 5-hours because Jetstar will not accept bags until 2-hours before a flight. This also meant that we could not get through security to reach a decent restaurant for those 5-hours as well and needed to just hang out in the outer airport by the ticket counters. But this still was not the end of our ordeal. As a cherry on top, we were rewarded by the likes of a very nasty counter clerk who insisted that the very same bags that we had dragged over from international were now 2kg overweight each and demanded another $60! What happened? Did our bags pick up 4kg of grime off the airport floors as we dragged them around behind us for the past 5-hours? We elected to throw out a couple of books and my hiking boots rather than pay these jokers another dime! Oh, and the domestic flight to Melbourne ended up delayed by 20 minutes.

Poor communication with all its customers from a cancelled flight to appalling after sales service. No care given to its obligations towards decent and basic customer service.

Bad communication and poor basic common sense and customer appreciation. This airline could change its perception within the industry if it focused more on the customer and not the bottom line in its business model. The fact that due to unforeseen circumstances that a flight can be canceled is one thing and sometimes very understandable for what ever reason. The after sales service of having to deal with providing alternative accommodation would also not be easy. But to take it’s stranded passengers two hours away to a partner accommodation rather than support more local townships with this business and not having a plan available that can handle this situation is just poor business management. This is not the first time this has happened and the fact that this is still happening with this airline after multiple similar experiences in the past 20 years clearly states that they have no interest or intention to offer a good or moderate customer satisfaction experience.

Jetstar is a budget airline so expectations should not be set too high. Having said that they should be efficient and professional. The flight to Cairns is just over 3 hours and was without incident, the staff went about their role in a business-like manner and provided food and drinks to purchase. The flight back was not quite as good. The forward toilet had the ""engaged"" light on from the start and I decided to check it out, there was a lady waiting who said that one of the flight attendants said there was someone in there. We concluded that if that was the case then due to the time they were in there they may have had a medical incident, so I decided to open the door. I discovered that there was no one in there but someone had thrown up in the sink and it was still there. In the meantime one of the flight attendants returned and proceeded to reprimand me for opening the door. Another flight attendant was talking to a passenger and was doing so for a large portion of the trip, another was in the last row reading a book. A couple of observations, the toilet appeared to be blocked from the time of leaving Cairns, why was it not fix prior to departure? There appeared to be a lack of service from the flight attendants. No information was passed on to the passengers regarding the forward toilet being out of action. An incident like this doesn't mean that Jetstar is a bad airline. There may be a need to train the staff on their attitude. Maybe their attitude is ""this is a budget airline so suck it up"".

I booked the flight and then looked at reviews - which is unusual for me as reviews are important to me. However, I am glad I chose to it this way round otherwise I wouldn’t have flown with jetstar. Once I booked I felt like I had made a mistake after seeing all of this bad reviews. I chose jetstar as the timing was great for me and so was the price. About $60 cheaper than air new zealand. I had just flown in from the UK and had checked myself in online and used the self service kiosk at Auckland airport to get the baggage tags. Auckland airport did have quite a long queue. Flights to queenstown, Christchurch, Dunedin & wellington were checking in. But the airport is very small so you wasn’t missing anything past check in anyway. Took me around 10 mins wait to get to the front (baring in mind that I was about the 40th behind so pretty fast. The lady at check in wasn’t particularly polite. But I was infront of her for less than 30 seconds. Passed me a boarding card and off I went. I know my luggage was about a kilo over too but nothing was mentioned and I didn’t need to pay any fee - however, if I did have to I wouldn’t have complained and blamed the airline. this is my problem. I know the baggage allowance and so does everyone else!!. Baggage wasn’t weighed for cabin, though they said several times that 7kg is the limit. So again, anyone who is over and charged the €60... there are NUMEROUS announcements before check in, and also information online about this so if you’re over you have to pay. I don’t understand the annoyance. Flight left on time & arrived on time. Pleasant crew, 3 female air hostess and a cabin manager called Dave. Was very nice. 2 females in the cockpit.

We booked two round way tickets - Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh. Due to health issues we needed an upgrade to business class on our flight back to Australia. We paid an additional $1584.22 for the upgrade. We were not advised there would be no refund applicable if our flight was cancelled (we have saved the chat history evidence, no such policies were mentioned). Due to foreseen circumstances, the original flight was cancelled and we were forced on to economy on the replacement flight when there were more than 2 seats available in the business cabin. (The response from their customers' service regarding this complaint was there were no seats in business which is not true) We were ensured by Jetstar staff we were guaranteed with business class seats on the replacement flight (online customer service representative and ground staff who I’ve confirmed with on the night of the cancellation ). I have saved all the chat history with the customer service representative. The Jetstar customer service representative has given us misleading information. Also in the attached itinerary, it shows our return flight is BUSINESS. If we were told originally that there would be no refund applicable in the event our flight was cancelled, we would not have upgraded the tickets in the first place. In summary, Jetstar has misled us and failed to deliver the service promised and subsequently stolen 1584.22 dollars from us. This is not a small amount of money and it was paid for a service which wasn't delivered. If we didn't pay for the upgrade, we will come home with zero additional cost. After lodging a complaint, they offered some travel vouchers (with time limits) as compensation.

I have flown with Jetstar from the very beginning when I first started flying and have never had a problem until now. My first international trip was a disaster to say the least. First of all we checked in and dealt with a rude staff member who separated my sister and I on the plane because he did not speak clearly whilst asking if I would able to help with the emergency exit if it were to come to that. Because he didn’t speak clearly I then said “sorry?” And then told me “it’s not a joke and they take it very seriously so you can’t sit together”. Fair enough although I did not hear this man so I found it very irritating to seperate us based on the fact he didn’t speak clear enough. After our flight we landed in Denpasar (Bali), we went to collect our luggage, stood there for an hour and my bag was no where to be found. After talking to the luggage people at the Denpasar airport, they have gave us a piece of paper and we had not heard anything else. We then put in a claim with Jetstar and waited to hear back from them, we found out our luggage had never actually left Brisbane, where we departed from. This was extremely frustrating as we were in a foreign country with no more then a couple pieces of clothes. Meanwhile waiting to hear back from Jetstar we had to spend a lot of money just to accomodate ourselves with clothes and everyday necessities. We had money, expensive clothes and undergarments in this bag. We finally heard from Jetstar 2 days into our trip saying our baggage was in Bali and they would deliver it to us at our villa. We sent our address and never heard back, here we are leaving and still don’t have our luggage. We went a week without anything, we constantly emailed Jetstar to see what they would do to compensate for this massive problem and they showed no compassion or care for what has happened and have only told us to wait. Luckily a nice man at the Denpasar airport has located our luggage and has set it up on our flight back home and that is the service we wanted. Jetstar has still not done anything at all to help, fix or apologise for this entire issue. Safe to say won’t be flying with Jetstar again.",2,4,1,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

He said I had a minimum of $60 to pay so I did, less then 2 mins later a lady tells me they overbooked the plane and I didn’t have a seat even though I booked months prior to our trip. They got us a seat on a Virgin plane and their baggage limit was different being 23kg per person so we absolutely did not need the extra $60 dollars worth that I spent on a different plane and airline. I went back to the man who charged us extra for a refund and he said he can’t do anything so we had to go online and talk to someone else for almost an hour but she just made excuse after excuse not to just give us the refund.",0,0,0,A320,Jetstar Airways

My experiences: - $120 to change a flight when the original flight was weeks out from departing. Flights are delayed all the time. Of the 13 flights I've taken, 3 have been delayed and 1 has been cancelled. Not a great track record. - They now weigh all baggage to the nearest gram. $60 fee if you're even slightly over. Explain to me how this isn't a money grab. Myself, a 65kg male with a bag weighing 7.1kg, gets charged $60 for an overweight bag when a larger man, probably 120kg+ has an underweight bag and is considered fine. If this actually about weight cumulative weight, my extra 100g would not make a difference. As said, one of my flights was cancelled. Fine, no worries, it happens. The problem is their customer service and focus, or lack thereof on customer satisfaction. Jetstar informed me that I would receive my refund in 7 working days. Warning: This is a lie. I attempted to fly on the 6th January 2019, this flight was cancelled. It is now the 26th April 2019 and still no refund to be seen. I called them today to which I was put on hold for half an hour and told was there was a 'technical glitch'. This 'glitch' seems a little coincidental when I'm asking for money back, especially from a company that loves to money grab at the slightest opportunity and lies about returning refunds. I digress. In my case, they cancelled the last flight out on a Sunday evening to which I had to spend an extra $100 to get to work the next day - not impressed. Might I add 0 compensation for this. You can tell Jetstar is an awful company to work for and their customer support policies highlight that. The girl dealing with my refund call said 'I'm sorry sir, I can understand why you are frustrated but I'm just following company policy'. I told her that my frustrations are not toward her but toward Jetstar as a company and how they operate. I've been on the other side of that coin in hospitality, I know how a disgruntled customer feels. I expressed to her that my frustrations were not with her, told her to enjoy her day and thanked her for her help. She thanked me at the end of the call for my understanding and to quote, I was the 'first person to ever say that'. Back to the point. This is a warning to anyone else - this company does not care about you. They do not care about their airline ranking. They don't care about providing customer satisfaction.

So no checked in luggage and no in-flight entertainment and no food or drinks served.

I went to the Jetstar service desk, carrying my carry on and motorbike helmet. I walked up to a guy to explain my situation, before I could even finish he just started talking over the top of me and said - I cannot take my motorbike helmet on and the bag I am carrying is over 7 kilos. I stated to him, how do you know its over 7 kilos? I was not aggressive but he could tell I was upset. I stated to him can I please get my meds out of my bag so i can fly, he stated and by this time i was surrounded by about 5 Jetstar staff - that it may not be possible and i may have to miss the flight if i was to get it? I stated I cannot fly with out it  he said  regardless of that you cannot take that helmet on board. He grabbed my ticket and saw that i was business, he then stated that I could take it on board but told ground staff to weigh it! No apology no nothing - Absolute power trip this guy was on and horrendous culture for other staff to be surrounding me. I decided to fly with out my meds,  I was extremely nervous I spoke with the co pilot on the flight who was awesome, the cabin crew were great as usual - Jetstar ground staff are rude, arrogant and unhelpful. I fly back from Bangkok on the 5th of March, it will be interesting to see the check in process.

I have just had the worst experience ever on a Jetstar flight! Yesterday I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Bali around 5:45 pm. Firstly, I got a message from Jetstar about delay for 2,5 hours due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Then after arriving to the airport for 2,5 hours later as was said we had to wait for another hour to be seated. When all passengers were finally seated the pilot announced that there is a small problem regarding air conditioner and we needed to wait for technicians to fix it. 1 h later the pilot apologised again and announced that the problem was almost fixed and we were expecting to depart soonish. After 1 hour more which was in total 2 hours of waiting on a plane we were informed that we weren’t able to depart that day and were asked to leave the aircraft. Then the lady on a check in desk advised calling helpline to figure out what my next steps are. So I immediately contacted Jetstar and after chatting with a staff member of the helpline the nearest available flight which they could provide was in 4 days after my actual one which means that I am going to lose 5 days of my holidays! I understand that technical issues can happen but to not accommodate and suggest a flight that would arrive 5 days later is ludicrous! You have effectively ruined more then half of my holiday. I had to buy another ticket through another airline and also requested a refund for my canceled flight because there was no point of flying 4 days later. However, customer service said that they would not reimburse for my accommodation and transport (for the extra incurred directly arising from jetstars failure). I will never ever fly through Jetstar airline again. Yes they have lower price in comparison to Qantas for example but it’s not worth it. Indeed I paid for another expensive ticket to get to my destination as soon as possible losing 400$ in total for transport and accommodation and the most importantly my holiday time. I would strongly recommend staying away from this company. It is just a nightmare dealing with them!",0,0,0,Boeing 787,Jetstar Airways

When we got to Melbourne, we were rushed to our next plane. We had no time to get food as planned and as a result, spent a lot on food to Denpasar.

JQ117 leaves Singapore at 5.20am and arrives Perth 12.30pm, with a 50min stop in Bali on the way. On this trip this A320 aircraft was 1 of 3 versions and had more legroom because the seat pocket was above the tray table. Other Jetstar flights I've flown domestically and internationally, my knees hit the seat in front due to the layout and lower seat pockets, so i was very pleased with legroom, however the seats are lacking some serious padding and if the seat behind you puts something in the seat pocket and closes their tray table, the object pokes you in the back. We were lucky to get row 4 and I was actually seated next to a Jetstar employee who was hitching a ride back to Perth after working the same trip in reverse the previous day. The 1st leg I unsuccessfully tried to sleep for the 1st 30mins as we had been in transit at Changi airport for about 9hrs. I then struck up conversation with the Jetstar employee the next 1.5hrs went quickly with conversation and soon we descended for landing. On arrival at Bali all passengers had to disembark with all luggage etc, even though the same aircraft was our aircraft continuing to Perth and our seats were exactly the same.. this is probably the most poorly organised part of the trip. We disembarked at gate 9b, the last and furthest gate of the terminal. The transit lounge, as we followed signage on and on is at the other end of the terminal, where our tickets and passports were checked again, then security check again, where we lost our water bottles again (you learn to travel with empty bottles because every time you go through security you lose it). The metal detector was so sensitive, the only metal my wife was wearing was her wedding bands and it still set off the sensor and she gad to be scanned manually. Meanwhile all this walking and lines for checks takes up quite a bit of time, so by the time we were through ( and remembering we were in the front of the the aircraft so we disembarked fairly quickly), they started final boarding call for our flight. We checked the monitors - go to gate 9b, looking down the long terminal we couldn't even see N o9 so we started our brisk walk, 3 kids in tow. At about 1/2 way 1 child needed a toilet stop so three kept going and I waited, hearing again the final boarding call. We basically jogged the next 4 gates thinking we would muss it. On arrival at the gate my flustered wife and 2 kids were waiting, unable to board because I had all the tickets and passports. Anyway, another line up for another security check, this time full open all bag checks? Thos that somehow found time to buy water, lost them again, I was down to my last empty bottle. Finally boarded to find my Jetstar friend still beside me and hadn't had to disembark, they couldn't believe we had all just had to go the full length of the airport twice and 2 more security checks to get back on the same aircraft,  by this time my wife and I were pretty annoyed. We had to wait a while for all passengers to board, the last passengers being 3 quite elderly people who were also very flustered and short of breath, i felt sorry that they to had to walk that marathon. I was told i could refill my water on the aircraft, I asked several times but never got it. I asked for one with my pre-purchased meal but was told I could only get coffee or tea, was never offered to purchase one? Poor customer service.

In short: Cheap flight that is not worth a penny. Ridiculous baggage restrictions with unreasonable extra costs, poor customer service, no complimentary drinks or snacks, no included meals for a 9 hr flight, and no in-flight entertainment. Jetstar ruined Christmas and was a terrible start to our holidays. My husband and I have been living abroad for a year now and we were really hoping to make it home for Christmas to see our families. Jetstar had a great price for flights, so we told our families we would be able to afford Christmas at home with them so long as they knew that we wouldn't be able to afford additional Christmas gifts. We each had 1 hiking backpack (to their low expectation of 30lbs per check-bag - which is 50lbs with every other airline), each had 2 small backpacks as a carry-on, and packed 2 suitcases of things we decided to fly home with us as we had accumulated quite a few things while living there on a Working Holiday Visa. We packed up a full suitcase filled with Australian treats - enough to fill a stocking for each of our siblings as well as our parents to thank each of them for hosting us while we were home for the holidays. I had prepaid for check-baggage prior to the flight - only to realize that the bags were limited to 30lbs, and that I wasn't able to purchase additional baggage (I assumed I'd be able to purchase these 2 additional bags once we arrived at the airport). I assumed wrong. We arrived at the airport with our pre-weighed carry-on backpacks and our 30lb check bags. I planned to pay the same steep rate of $115 per additional check-bag (of only 30lbs and not the regular 50lbs) once we got there, though while checking in, we were told that was not an option and that we would need to pay $25 per kg. We were quoted a total of $1300 for our additional bags. We paid $1400 ($700 each) for our flights, $230 for our pre-paid luggage, and then would have paid $1300 dollars extra to get 2 suitcases home - both at 50lbs. More than our flights! We stepped aside and sorted through our luggage to decide what we were able to bring home. We narrowed our bags down to 1 suitcase and packed it to 20 kilos. We were charged an additional $500 for 1 suitcase  to fly back home. A whole suitcase of Christmas gifts had to be thrown out as we could not afford to take it home to our families. We found a security guard, asked him if he had kids, and said Merry Christmas. I wish it had ended there. The lady checking us in couldn't put our payment through as her computer wasn't working. When she finally got us checked in, her payment terminal wasn't functioning. Once the payment was put through, we had to move over to someone else that then printed our boarding passes for us. She also told us that they weren't going to be able to get us a seat together -  the best part is that the plane was half empty - and the lady sitting a couple of rows up from us got to lay on the 4 seats in the middle on her own because her ankle was sore and she wanted to put her feet up. They didn't have complimentary drinks, no complimentary snacks, or meals for a 9 hr flight. On top of that, your only option for entertainment was to pay a $10 fee for in-flight entertainment as they didn't have any movies to show on the plane - and they couldn't even make the effort to get us a seat beside each other with half of the plane empty.",1,1,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

As we are french, I explained that there were a misunderstanding, that we bought flights less than an hour, the money is still in the cash register, the cash is our holidays budget. So she went to see the man and her manager. After few minutes, she came back and confirm us that we can't be refund and there is no credit voucher either because the tickets are not refundable.

I chose to travel with Jetstar Airways because of their promo priced at SGD130 for return, I usually pay sgd250-280 to garuda (as I have flexi schedule so travel any day is not a problem for me) with baggage allowance of 30kg and onboard meals, so I thought Iit wise for me to try Jetstar Airways out this time since I travel light. But this prove me wrong as they asked to weigh my bag at the self check in kiosks including my laptop bag and total allowance is only 7kg, how can this be possible? Even Scoot which is also one of the budget airline allowed 10kg cabin excluding laptop bag, I wonder how can they include the laptop bag to a total of 7kg allowance, I don't think anyone would be able to get thru this if you travel with a small cabin bag plus laptop, as laptop itself is normally 3kg and plus an empty cabin bag is 2kg, so unless you bring nothing in the cabin bag, else for sure you will need to buy a checkin bag on last minute which will cost you SGD60 which is half of the price of the airfare and not to add in the return baggage as well which will almost close to the price I pay to Garuda which is not a budget airline! So why should I still travel with Jetstar Airways in the future -totally pointless! First time encountered this with a budget airline and I will never travel with them again and won't bother to care about their promo caused this should not be the way for them to conduct business to suck their customer money like this and I feel is not ethical to use this way to lure your customer by promo but suck their money by forcing as in fact all of us caught by surprise and have no choice to pay.",0,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

By the time we fought through immigration at MEL, our bags were waiting on the carousel. There were 4 complaints which put me off Jetstar: We had our luggage and hand luggage searched / screened twice by Airport officials, but Jetstar had their staff search people's hand luggage for 'liquids' before allowing passengers into the gate. What they were really doing was taking people's duty free alcohol that they had bought in the airport.  When I was considering purchasing meals for breakfast, I was unable to select the second (breakfast) service. Breakfast options were the same as dinner - why not put on some breakfast options. I will likely fly with Jetstar shorthaul at some stage, (I will give preference to Qantas / Virgin) but for 3hrs + I will stick to a full service airline in the future. You do need to purchase your luggage, entertainment and meals. I would recommend doing this when you book your ticket to save money. We booked more luggage than we ended up needing at a reasonable price. I would recommend choosing seats in the front sections in rows 11 and 12.

I was accomodated onto the next flight for Japan, which was within two hours, and was even able to get a coffee and cake at the cafe inside while I was waiting. The only problem was I had to go to Osaka airport instead of Tokyo (I've lived in Japan for over two years so I at least knew what I was in for) The problem I did have though was when I tried to claim the unexpected costs of transferring back to Tokyo once I arrived. I chatted to staff online and they were brilliant, very understanding and professional the entire time. Even when I had to explain the situation a few times to different people. Once I had a manager assigned to my case it was resolved within a few days. I was really impressed with how the situation was resolved with minimal fuss.

We are Asians in appearance but both my husband and I are physicians from the USA.  As she was printing our boarding passes and luggage tags, she said she could see that we paid for two checked-in bags but she could not locate which passengers they were paid under, therefore she still had to charge us for the two checked in bags. I said I had the receipt for the paid checked-in bags. She looked through the computer again and said she still had to charged me for the two checked in bags. I could not believe it! It does not make any sense. I said I was not going to pay again because she could not find it. It is a form of incompetence. She then said ""I am not going to serve you anymore. You have to go to someone else."" and left me there standing. She did not tell me where to go initially. She was clearly doing that to delay my check-in process as a punishment and aggravates my anxiety as the flight departure time was approaching. I then requested to speak to her supervisor. Her supervisor was better but obviously not well trained for customer service (did not display ability to de-escalate the situation). But she figured out the problem was the car seat. Apparently the agent does not know that. She needs to be trained better but that is the least of her problem. Jetstar lost our car seat on the same flight which we learned about we got to Auckland.

I asked to be put on another flight as I had a meeting in Melbourne at 5. Jetstar refused because they had a later flight. Offered refund, but I had to eat all the fees, so the full refund was about 60%. booked on a Virgin flight for $200 more, but got there. Second, a policy issue. Flying from Cairns to Hobart via Melbourne. Jetstar will NOT check baggage through. Had to retrieve bags in Melbourne re-check them (and go through security, wait at check-in counter all over again). When I asked an employee why we could not check through he said that they were such a budget airline that they refused to pay for someone to sort the bags as they come out of the plane. He was completely embarrassed by this policy. From a customer standpoint it is tremendously inconvenient. I will never fly with Jetstar again!",1,0,0,Boeing 737,Jetstar Airways

Two cards failed to work and one notifies me if the payment is declined so I know there was no problem on my side. Luckily, I left the option on as unpaid so wasn't charged extra at the airport.

Also, if you want a copy of everything said in the chat, you have to speak to a different team. This is basic functionality available in most live chat services. I contacted them with a complaint. The first response was just excuses and the offer of a voucher which can only be used by me and expires in 6 months. I live in the UK so completely useless.

The aircraft was in OK condition, my seat was bearable for a one hour flight, Jetstar got me to my destination on time and my bag arrived on the baggage carousel. But it's very difficult to travel on this airline without thinking that they take every opportunity to shakedown their customers. In the departure lounge, I witnessed people being asked for more money for their carry-on. Thanks to other posters on this site, I knew in advance to check in my bag (which other airlines accept as carry-one without question), so it didn't affect me personally. I had bought a starter-plus bundle, which at the time of purchase was claimed to offer standard seat allocation, a baggage allowance, frequent flyer points, and a snack. When I received the itinerary, there was no mention of the snack. Equally, when I received the boarding pass, there was no mention of the snack, either, but there was a four digit code, so I asked a crew member at checkin what the four digit code was and she replied that it was because I had paid to have my seat allocated in advance (seat allocation is part of the starter-plus bundle). When the cabin crew were promoting the sale of snacks and drinks, they said that they would accept Mastercard, Visa, or American Express, but they said nothing about people who had bought the starter-plus bundle. When the crew member serving snacks got to my seat, I showed her the boarding pass and asked her if it entitled me to a snack. Yes, she said, your choice up to $10. Why don't they print this on the boarding pass and announce it when about to serve snacks? I nearly went without – I thought I must have got the wrong idea about what was included in the starter-plus bundle. I can't help but get the feeling the airline wanted me (and other starter-plus customers) to forget the fact that the bundle includes a snack. No doubt it's more profitable if people pay for a second time, or go without, as I nearly did. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth but, like the shakedown in the departure gate, seems typical of this airline, which only seems to care about opportunities for more money.",4,0,0,A320,Jetstar Airways

Upon checkin in Cairns I was asked to show an onward ticket which I did not have and was refused the check in. I have travelled a few times to Japan with other airlines and this has never happened. I know the rules, which are 'may refuse'. The rule is meant to avoid suspicious people to get to the destination, be refused entry and sent back, apparently at the airline's expense. This rule is flawed because, upon arrival, the traveler's ticket will not be for that day, it may be up to 3 months in the future. Internet tickets are generally not allowed to be changed or cancelled. But if a ticket can be cancelled (such as 1st class tickets), then the traveller can cancel it straight after checkin anyway. The Jetstar personnel was unsympathetic to the extent of malicious and could have caused me to lose not only my $700 flight, plus the other inconveniences with missing the flight, but also to lose my hotel reservation in Tokyo. But ultimately, it is not just the money, but the unpleasantness of having to deal with their personnel as badly suited to their job as they were.

But Jetstar gets worse and worse as an airline year after year. I got the Max Bundle as I thought it would make the flight more comfortable and would reduce the cost of adding 40kg's anyhow. Neither was true. I did not get my upfront seat selection! The upfront area of the aircraft for max bundle is behind a whole section of economy class seats that weren't even available as an up front option with the max bundle. So the whole upfront seat selection is a lie. What else do you get with the Max bundle. One really small bad 'meal'. Apparently a voucher to use on another Jetstar flight if you cancel. I didn't need to, but I can imagine the process is at least as awful as the rest of the booking process. What you don't get with the Max Bundle: A blanket or anything to make the flight more comfortable. Inflight entertainment. All that costs a lot more. You also don't get the seat you book.

As most people that fly with mountain bikes know, they typically come in around 23kg if packed in a commercial bike bag. Most airlines have at least a 23kg weight allowance and typically don't apply any oversize changes to sporting goods. I have flown overseas and intestate with Qantas, Virgin, Air New Zealand and Air Canada with a bike bag weighing between 23 and 24kg when packed and never once had an issue having it checked as my included bag. It has always without exception been carried under the flight's standard included luggage allowance This all changed when I flew the first (and last time) with Jetstar (on the return leg of a qantas flight) Jetstar only allow 20kg (which if you use a good commercial bike bag and have mountain bike you're almost certainly not going to come in under) AND an oversize bag charge that isn't waived for sporting goods like most airlines. This charge along with their $15 PER Kg charge will add about $70 to your flight each way. They will not take into account that you flew out with their partner airline on the same booking with which can lead to some obvious confusion when you cant come back with the luggage you flew out with. To top it of once they know you're at your weight limit the smell blood and really go in for the kill to make an extra buck. On our return flight the resorted to the utterly stupid level of weighing the wallets/purses you're carrying on board (even if they are not going in the carry on). While I acknowledge the whole ""we need to weigh your wallet and purse"" thing was probably just got someone having a bad day at check in it does go to underline the clear culture is making money from baggage charges however possible that must permeate through the airlines culture.

I understand that Jetstar is a budget airline, and that the best quality of customer service, flight comfort, and safety can’t be expected. However, it’s extremely unreasonable to do carry on baggage weight checks at the gate and not at the check-in outside of security, and then require passengers to pay 60 dollars to check in a bag. Had we been given this option, we would have put more weight into our actual checked luggage that still has extra room in it. Had we been given fair notice of this, then we could have easily gone back out of security and added more to our checked bag. The staff at the gate were extremely rude and not willing to explain why we couldn’t just add our bag to our checked bag weight allowance, or why the bags that people were being forced to check in were all the charged the same price when they were all different sizes and weights. We had a customer service agent rudely address us, and I boarded the plane feeling I’d been robbed. I know that this won’t change any of Jetstars backward policies, but I hope that in the future, Jetstar is more prudent about how it goes about monitoring the weight going onto the plane.

My two bags combine a weight of 14.1 kg. Now the staff tell me maximum for domestic business is 10kg (says nothing about that in the email confirmation). I tell her about the email and she acts cocky (like i'm lying). Now when showing her she claims that that's only valid for international travel. Then I ask how I could possibly know that when it says 14kg on my domestic confirmation. Her answer is that everything is clear. We were already paying for 60kg check-in luggage for two people. They had us reorganize our packing over 4kg claiming it's for security reasons. Then what they are saying is that it's more secure with 14 kg on international flights and that most airlines in the world flying A320s isn't safe enough as they are not applying these ridiculous rules.

However the departure gate was right at the far end of the terminal. It took ages to get to and it included various flights of stairs. Once there there wasn't anywhere near enough seating made available to sit and wait before boarding. This was made worse by very weak airconditioning. This is despite the airline requesting all passengers be there not less than 30 minutes before boarding time. It was a tiny plane. I was unable to move whilst in my seat and due to lack of space only got to make use of 1 of the 2 armrests. Cabin was dirty all over. As was the magazine which had all the puzzles filled in by previous passengers. My ticket said I was to get a $10 meal voucher but this never occurred. The menu was pretty awful anyway and staff service non-existent. It was a very boring flight even despite its brevity as there was no inflight entertainment.

After trying to explain that I had no issues at all and the garments were only for burn compression, I was moved to another seat and told to contact Jetstar if I wanted a refund.

Jetstar imposes a highly restrictive and inflexible baggage weight policy. Jetstar does clearly articulate the requirements that must be met to avoid their unreasonable excess baggage weight fees, but if you are unaware and are over their limit, you will be unpleasantly surprised. In my case, my carry on bag was 12 Kg, 5 Kg above their 7 Kg maximum. I could not fit anymore items into my checked baggage to offset this weight. So, Jetstar charged me, not for the excess (5 Kg), but for the whole 12 Kg at NZD 15/Kg or NZD 180! This was far more than the cost of my seat on the flight from Queenstown to Auckland.

This was my first fight with Jetstar and had no previous expectations of the airline. We had quite a bit of luggage as we were moving from Canada to Australia and had everything that we came over with, so we had to purchase extra luggage. Although we had to pay the extra surcharge for 30 kg's of checked luggage each the price was very reasonable (Considering a similar flight in Canada would probably be double the cost). Prior to boarding I saw another Jetstar flight weighing carryon baggage to make sure that everyones carryon baggage met the standard of 7kg. I was a little worried because although we only had a backpack each, 7kgs is not a lot of weight. However, when it was time for our flight to board we did not have to weigh our carry on bags. I am not sure why we got the pass on the scale and the other flight had to weigh their bags. The flight itself took off on time and had the seatbelt sign off within a few minutes. We were in Seats 20 E & F, however as there was a kid kicking the back of my seat I moved as there was free seats in row 20 ABC. The leg room was probably the worst pitch I have ever sat in, coming in at 29 inches. I am 188cm (6' 2"") tall, so this was uncomfortable for me however anyone smaller would be okay for the short flight. The staff came around just after take off to do a service. Standard stuff was available for purchase (hot/cold drinks, sandwiches, snacks), but there was no complementary drinks or snacks. There was a family sitting in the 2 rows behind us that had 5 small kids that were making a lot of noise and not following the seatbelt sign. At one point the staff acted very professionally and asked the parents to get the kids back in their seats for landing. We landed on time and exited the plane on the tarmac, but were walking distance to the terminal so we didn't need a bus. Overall an average flight for the price we paid, I probably would not recommend as the legroom was uncomfortable and there were a lot of families and children that made the flight seem chaotic at times. The price was okay though, and as long as you know what you were getting into with a low cost airline it is an okay way to get around Australia for a reasonable price.",0,0,0,A320,Jetstar Airways

What annoys me is Christchurch jet star didn’t weigh our bags. Shouldn’t rules be the same for Christchurch and Auckland? When I spoke to another staff member she said that Auckland is Auckland and Christchurch is Christchurch. That doesn’t make sense to me. I say that’s poor team work and rules aren’t very consistent.

They were thinner than other  seats, which enabled a greatly increased amount of leg room. They shifted the seat pocket to above the tray table, thus increasing the leg room. The cabin crew was nice with positive attitudes towards passengers. My only complaint would be the inadequate amount of lavatories onboard (only one in the front and two in the rear) compared to five in some airlines' A321s, but it's a budget airline, and it's not too bad for a 55-minute flight.

I received a message 3 minutes before walking out the door to catch my late evening flight with Jetstar. ""Your flight from Sydney is cancelled. Go to website to check your flight options. We're sorry your flight has been cancelled."" Bit of a pathetic apology, but I jumped online immediately to investigate. This was due to bad weather - so not Jetstar's fault, but their responsibility to compensate none-the-less especially considering other airlines were still flying from Sydney, and I was paying for a promised service. My reason for booking a late flight was that I was working my part time job (ie.can't afford the higher fares for Qantas or Virgin) in the day and needed to fly from Sydney to Melbourne for a job interview. The interview was at 9am on Thursday, so the alternative afternoon flights they were offering on Thursday afternoon were not a solution. I was told that I could swap my flight for an afternoon flight on Thursday, or morning flight on the Friday. Or a voucher for the amount of the cancelled flight. I explained that my reason for travel was a job interview in the morning (not just leisure or an unimportant trip) and therefore an afternoon flight was pointless. I could not be flexible - not to mention my return flight to Sydney was scheduled for 3pm. Arrive in Melbourne at 1pm and return to Sydney at 3pm the same day?? I told them I had no need for a change of time and date unless that change landed me in Melbourne in time for my interview. I was given more options (and then fewer options) for Thursday afternoon or Friday, and not one that actually properly compensated me for this cancellation. A voucher provided in five business days was not a solution, and with no extra planes added the following day to compensate for the hundreds of passengers put out; I was left with no solutions, and out of pocket. Finally I agreed to their only form of refund (despite the assistant explicitly saying at one point Jetstar can refund cash depending on the reason...ie whether they deem it worthy). It was this point that I was offered the amount for the cancelled flight, only. They still tried to charge me the cost of the return flight despite cancelling my initial flight! The attempt to still charge me for the return flight, after an hour of nil solutions, was enough to firm my mind. Avoid Jetstar. They do not care about their customers. They are a budget airline because they take advantage of their customers to make a profit. I could only just afford the flight to an interview.

My booking had me flying to Osaka and travelling by late night bullet train to Nagoya. As I arrived at Brisbane airport I received an SMS stating that my Jetstar flight from Cairns to Osaka has been cancelled. It took 90 minutes before Jetstar provided a solution- a flight on Qantas to Tokyo not Osaka. So I arrived late at night, miles from Osaka and had to arrange bullet train to Nagoya at my expense. This was my second Jetstar international flight that Jetstar cancelled and transferred the recovery costs to me. Behind schedule I decided to return on the same flight but extend for five days. The Jetstar Indian based dialogue centre tried to charge me $630 to change my flight. I rejected and used the ""manage my flight"" option. I was charged $300. My complaint letter to Jetstar was acknowledged, by a corporate apologist who stated that I had changed my return route. I hadn't changed my route - I changed the day. The excuse for their cancellation was unavoidable technical difficulties. So my experience with Jetstar is two cancelled flights with no apology or compensation for the extra costs.

On board, the service was good, but not great, and overall tolerable for the short hour-long flight to Melbourne-Avalon. The return flight  on May 17 was very similar, with some divergences.

After a lot of talking the lady of the checkin desk managed to get me on the standby flight that should have left at 08:35 but was late and eventually left at my originally scheduled flight time of 09:10. I had 5 mins to get to the gate and through security. I was grateful to get the flight but very unhappy with the lack of communication from Jetstar Airways leading to the cancellation of the flight. Lots of other passengers who also turned up for the cancelled flight stated they had not received any cancellation texts or emails. One person stated they received the message at approximately 5am.

I do not recommend Jetstar if you want good customer service. I cannot comment on the actual flight as it hasn't happened yet, but I'm thinking I won't even be getting on the plane. I flew from Minneapolis to Auckland, visiting New Zealand on holiday before I start my working holiday visa in Australia. I do not have any solid travel dates but knew that I had to be in Australia by April 16th. I was told at the ticket counter that I could not board unless I had a flight out of New Zealand. This is my fault as I misunderstood the conditions of traveling into a country via visitor's visa vs. a working holiday visa. I was under the impression I could enter the country as long as I had enough money to purchase a flight out of the country. I had to book my flight at the ticket counter and fast since my flight was about to leave. I booked through kayak.com. I purchased insurance as I was under the impression I could use it to change or cancel my flight if I needed to. Apparently, kayak has their settings set to round trip by default and I accidentally booked a flight out of Auckland to Sydney on March 7th and then right back to Auckland from Sydney on March 8th in less than 24 hours. I noticed this mistake on my layover in Los Angeles and called the airline immediately to try and get a refund for the return ticket. Usually airlines will let you cancel of change your flight within 24 hours of the booking. Not Jetstar. They will do nothing to help me. I've talked to their customer service team about 4 or 5 times and they do not care about their customers. They won't even offer me a refund via voucher. The insurance I purchased to Allianz is a farce as well. The box I checked to purchase the insurance said it covered cancellations and changes to your flight. What they don't mention is that it only covers cancellations of changes if you or your travel companion is injured or ill and you must provide extensive proof of this. I will be contacting my bank to dispute all of the charges and I'm confident they'll get my money back. Jetstar will also be losing a customer.",0,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

We left Denpasar airport a bit late due to several excuses, the main excuse was paperwork. We have already boarded the aircraft and waited on the ground for about an hour which made us miss our connecting flight to Auckland. Ground staff was a bit slow on giving us information about what was going on which made some of us very stressed and uncomfortable. The connecting flight that we were meant to be on had already left at 11.05pm when we arrived at 12am. Jetstar gave us accommodation and told us that we were on the next flight out which was at 9.10am but due to the immigration not giving us Indonesians visas we were unable to go to the hotel which meant we had to make ourselves comfortable in the transit area (which weirdly you had to call someone to open the door for you, it is so impractical when you are in a rush). We were given food vouchers worth $20 each (no shops were open at that time so we were starving). We were going to get our boarding tickets at the gate and the ground service were very aggressive and so unfriendly and rude which put us off so much. Overall, the cabin staff were alright but I've seen happier more friendlier cabin staff on other airlines. I recommend that Jetstar should really get their services to prioritise customers that have had disrupted flights and also train their staff to be more friendly and not so rude and aggressive. It would have made it more pleasant if the ground staff were more helpful and informative. Also on the flight from Auckland to Denpasar via Melbourne, our baggage had been left in Melbourne for around 3/4 days. Our baggage was meant to be checked in all the way through to Denpasar but obviously did this not happen. Not sure who to blame, Melbourne airport or Jetstar but this is really not a good way to start a holiday. We had to leave for Surabaya on the very next day we arrived in Denpasar which meant we had to drive 3 hours to the airport to claim our bags.

That I was okay with, however, what I found somewhat appalling was the nearly 45 minute wait to be checked in, as Jetstar have cut down staffing levels to just three team members checking in my flight and another flight to Melbourne (some 300 people in total), which left me with little time to enjoy the sights of this small but wonderful airport. Boarding was efficient, and I was also allocated an exit row seat upon my check-in. However, the crew were very robotic, and even though this was only a flight of some 90 minutes to Sydney, just did not seem to be interested or attentive. With the exception of the in-flight magazine, there was no entertainment available, and the rather limited in-flight menu made me regret not purchasing something at the airport (Vietnamese ""Pho"" was little more than a cup-a-soup with bits of meat in it). Overall, Jetstar just doesn't seem to be as good a carrier as it was just a few years ago, and when compared to recent flight experiences on Tiger Airways, doesn't seem to provide that memorable flight experience, especially where service, catering and crew are concerned.

I was travelling in New Zealand and I received an email from Jetstar informing me that my flight on 4th December to Kuala Lumpur had been cancelled. There was no back-up plan nor any other flight options made available except to call the customer service team. The next available flight was the following day – the 5th (the original date I booked) and which we were told that we could confirm our presence 3 hours prior to the departure time. We called back 12 hours later and we were told that nothing could be done because the flight is now full. We needed to wait for 2 more days for the next available flight. When we asked if we could book other tickets back to Kuala Lumpur with the cost fully reimbursed the customer service answered that this is subject to the approval from the claims department. It is obvious that booking flights at such a last minute will be extremely costly, which defeats the purpose of purchasing the cheap fares from Jetstar months in advance. So no flight, no other options, except to accept the refund of the money paid or wait for the next flight out. To add on, the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful. Upon checking-in in New Zealand for our flights back to Melbourne, we spoke to the customer service at the airport. In less than 15 minutes, they confirmed 2 seats for us for the 5th December which was what we have been told that the flight was full. Fast forward to the day of the flight (2 days later) – once again another frustrating e-mail which stated a delay in the flight from 1200 hour to 1350 hour. Bearing in mind that we have a transit at the Singapore airport, the email stated arrival time to be 1840 hour whilst the departure from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was at 1945 hours. However on the plane, the captain announced that the ETA was at 1930. Logically speaking, we expected that the Jetstar crew would have had the information for passengers who are transiting in Singapore for the KL flight. Hence, they would have been aware that the Melbourne flight was delayed thus wait for these us to arrive. On our way there we even heard them calling out name, so I immediately stop by the information counter to request for them to hold the gate as our flights were delayed. The gate was closed when we arrived. We explained ourselves, but once again nothing could be done despite already having our boarding pass in hand. They even checked our seat numbers but still the same answer. At the transfer counter, I was told by the airport staff that the flight we had just missed was the last flight out. And to top it all, the representative only showed up after close to 2 hours later. No apologies, nothing. It was as if nothing had happened and we should be thankful for the arrangements made. When it was our turn, he quickly briefed us on the flight to be taken then next day and the accommodation provided for the night. I asked if we had any other options and all he answered was no because that was the last flight and that is all they can do. I even asked if we could book any other available flight and get Jetstar to reimburse the full cost.

Would they move us? Yes for $300 more. Seeing as our ticket only cost $400 for a return that didn't seem good value. We pointed out that if they shifted us onto a flight leaving in 30 minutes with no chance of selling that space they would then have 4-5 hours to sell our seats on to someone else. No chance.

I added the business max package as this was our holiday of a lifetime through Europe and my wife had 5yrs earlier donated a kidney to me. I wanted this to be a special experience. 4 weeks out the return arrangements were changed from a direct flight to coming via Singapore with a different code flight. A little inconvenient but not being seasoned travelers didn't worry. At 5pm the day before departure Jetstar emailed that the outbound flight was cancelled. Their call center organized seats on a Qantas domestic to Sydney and connected to Qantas to Bangkok. The call center were deceptive in not disclosing there were no business class seats available on either leg. When asked the seat numbers we were told these would be allocated at the airport. At the terminal when all was disclosed Jetstar after 12minutes wait advised to see the Jetstar staff at the terminal. Our Qantas flight was due to leave at 6.30am, Jetstar staff don't start work till 7am. This flight was our only option to make our connection in Bangkok. After our holiday and 2 days before Bangkok we found our seating allocated Bangkok to Singapore as 1A & 1B. We boarded Jetstar Asia to find their is no business class and apparently you order meals in advance on their web site but non of this was ever advised and so no meals were provided. A coffee was $4.

Little did I know that Gold Coast airport, which is over 100km away from Brisbane airport, can be used interchangeably. So it wasn't until I arrived at Brisbane that I realized my mistake. Thankfully the kind staff at Jetstar did me the favour of allowing me to pay a $50 fee and catch the next flight out of Gold Coast, provided I could make the flight. Please Jetstar, you shouldn't have. Upon arriving at Gold Coast, I promptly paid the $50 fee and queued for the baggage drop. The agent at the baggage drop informed me that I was over the allowable limit for my checked baggage. Being familiar with airport procedures, I said ""Ok, just let me put the excess into my carry-on."" He replied by asking me to put my carry-on as well as my laptop (?) on the scale. He then informed me that I was 16kg overweight. I reluctantly agreed to pay for it, until he informed me that it would cost me $240 additional. So if I were to have taken that offer, I would have paid almost 4X the advertised price at a whopping $440. Thanks Jetstar! I went back to the help desk and there was a lot of hand wringing. And they had the gall to tell me they were doing me a favour by bending the rules by letting me pay the $50.

The economy seat was not comfortable but acceptable, except the IFE was not operating. I hadn't included it in my options but I did need to charge my iPhone and iPad so I could continue to access my own 'entertainment package'. But the USB port was not functioning either. I mentioned it to staff after a couple of hours (the batteries were flat). Staff offered to relocate me to a seat where the IFE worked and also offered complimentary access to the IFE to compensate for the inconvenience. Sensible and polite. That's a tick. I brought my own picnic lunch/dinner - 2 boiled eggs, 2 rolls, 3 onigiri (Japanese rice balls), some fruit and a bottle of water purchased in the boarding area. This was fortuitous as the offered fried rice/noodles options looked OK but pedestrian whereas my little 'picnic' meals were appetising and delicious.

It did not feel like a normal flight on another aircraft type, but it instead felt much worse than that. We already had a 30mins delay waiting for pushback from Bali's Ngurah Rai airport, for a reason the pilot did not even announce. Additionally it was a red-eye flight, which means that sleep is important on such flight. However this is the least duration of sleep I could ever get on a red eye flight which will be explained further below. Mood lighting was there but not effective at all. The IFE was there with a responsive touchscreen, although money is required to pay for most of the IFE content. Seats were horrible. Leather seats are not at all comfortable, inhibits sleep, as well as those hard headrests that felt very weird to adjust. Seat itself was very narrow at less than 17 inches, and armrest was ridiculously narrow not a hand can comfortably rest on them. The seat pitch was also very narrow at what felt like 30 inches, extremely cramped, and all these contributed to my sleeplessness. What's more the plane was scorching hot, so more than an hour of sleep seems like an incredible feat to do on such a plane. Meal was bland, only the sauce had a slight bit of flavour, although the dessert made up for the bad food. Cabin crew were average with nothing remarkable to speak of. The same can be said on the return flight. Hot plane, narrow seats, bland food but with great deserts, average crew, same IFE.

We'll employ Excuse Code No: 5 of about 10 - which in my case was ""your aircraft has been delayed in Auckland due to 'engineering requirements'"", thus we can merge the two half empty flights into one - and save on the running costs. Who knows - but it's mighty suspicious when you would expect the airport to be full of 2 sets of passengers waiting to travel - yet hello - it was still just one plane load 3 and a half hours later.

The staff were friendly enough and the queue was not actually that long, but without having self check-in facilities, having on average just 2 staff check people in was not enough. In comparison, all the AirNZ / Virgin Australia check-ins operating (about 6 or so) and they have self service check-ins - hence no real queue there. Therefore my rating for Jetstar, and Qantas for that matter, for check-in service out of Queenstown is 1/10. While I can't rate the delayed flight home at this point, on balance, everything about the flight to Queenstown from Auckland was great. Easy check-in, no delays and comfortable enough flight (although we were lucky and had 6 seats between the 4 of us) on which the crew were great. So 9/10 for that part of the trip.

In my 40 years of travel this was the absolute worst service ever encountered. As a result of a minor problem with Australian visa and Jetstar refusal to assist, we missed the first leg of international flights and had to re-book.

Unfortunately, Jetstar had closed the boarding gate and we missed the flight. The counter personnel at the Queenstown airport were extemely rude. In addition, the Jetstar website is very confusing.

I had a choice for the same price, between Cathay Pacific in economy via Hong Kong or Jetstar in business class via Cairns. Jetstar had more convenient timings so I took the chance. Then I panicked because the ticket and the website indicated that I would have to collect my bags in Cairns and check back in. However, at check-in in Melbourne, I was given both boarding passes and my bags were checked through to Tokyo - this seems to be the norm for the Tokyo and Osaka flights but I can’t find anywhere where I was told that in advance. A good thing, too, since the Melbourne-Cairns flight left 63 minutes late despite boarding on time (they’ve got a reputation to maintain). The flight to Cairns had no business section so I was stuck in economy in an exit row seat, plenty of room but next to the noisy galley and toilets. The Boeing 787’s electronically-dimmed windows just don’t work in direct sun and my head got very hot and it was impossible to sleep. The quieter engines don’t translate into a quieter cabin - seems like some machinery is very loud, perhaps for the higher cabin pressures (the higher pressures may however have reduced the screaming from the usual gaggle of families). On the the Cairns-Tokyo leg I was in the first “business” row and it’s directly equivalent to premium economy elsewhere. The seat actually felt less roomy than the Cathay Pacific premium economy I was in a few weeks ago, even though 2x3x2 in a 787 should have more space than 2x3x2 in the narrower A330. The food was fairly good but they offered lower-end alcohol options compared to most airlines.

Boeing 787 new and quite quiet in the front. Hate the electronic window shading, was in control of the cabin staff so it was either all open or all dark. It was a night flight and I was watching the huge fires and some wicked lightening storms till they darkened the windows for people to sleep. Sorry but what was happening out the window was better than the in-seat entertainment. The seat has plenty of leg room but I don't think there was one seat where the recline/foot rest worked properly - there was a lot of times when the cabin crew were wrestling with seat. Recline is huge but you're reclining into the space of the person behind you. It happened to me - the tiny TV drops to where you can't view it unless your neck is double-jointed. You can't get up to go to the toilet without some contortions and using the headrest of the seat in front and then you receive that disgusted look because you woke them up.  Entertainment small screen was just that, small, very small and not great quality. And I ran out of movies to watch about 3 hours from touchdown on a 7.5 hour flight. What an awful poor choice - and in Business class! Food not quite as good as other airlines economy food. I was in row 2 of business class and they ran out of the first choice in row 2. Well actually they didn't run out because our friends (also in row 2) shortly after being fobbed off with the fish, noted that row 2 and 3 of the other side of the business cabin got the first choice. So that's a bit of an insult to be told that it's out to then watch people being served it after you. First choice - a Pie, no veggies, no potatoes, nothing but a pie! Had to check I was in business class! Drinks offer a good choice, and always there if you wanted it. Cabin staff were mainly good and attentive (not that we wanted much) but a bit disappointed with the lack of checking for meals. Goodies Pack was great:- earplugs, eye mask, toothbrush, tube socks (not so great), hand cream, lip balm, neck pillow and the bag it came in can be used as a computer tablet bag. There is one thing that all airlines should realize; tube socks don't work in the toilet (think about it). Ground service I've marked low for one reason - although we were the first off the plane we were last away from the baggage carousel as our bags came out last (that will teach us to be first at the airport!) Business class baggage came out last! Overall the whole thing was very amateurish, I wasn't expecting top of the line business class, but it should have been up to at least premium economy standards of other airlines.

In fact, I don't even have time for it. Jetstar managed to screw my whole week up just because of their incompetence. It's not about the money I need to spend buying new things, it's the time that I don't have. Why should I have to suffer for their negligence. After calling them, which they clearly did not take me seriously, all the operator could say was ""we can't do anything"". The operator was unhelpful and snobbish. I am not after the compensation, I just wanted to know how they are able to help. Such cases have happened to me and I received my baggage within 24 hours (Singapore Airlines). I am now currently stuck in Cairns with nothing but a phone and a dying laptop and my whole trip ruined, while they insist on not providing any other help.

Check in queue was quite long but it moved along ok. However at Brisbane it was inconvenient that they did the handcarry size and weight check after check-in which meant queuing up 4 times before actually boarding and made worse with the lack of seats immediately at the gate because they put the flight next to several other minor routes instead of some priority spacing unlike other carriers had set up. Booking the flight through the Jetstar website was good. The interface was easy enough and the early check-in feature and early seat selection are big drawcards for me. I think its a great idea for the cabin crew to direct passengers to their seat because one of them omitted this on my flight down to Brisbane and it meant someone took my seat by mistake until I pointed this out to the cabin crew.

I was informed that if I did this I would have to pay for the flight again as it was not to the same airport and that I would not be refunded.

On arriving at Sydney T2 we found that we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the scheduled 15.20 departure. This meant trying to find somewhere to sit in a heavily overcrowded departure lounge while guarding our luggage. The preferred method of checking in seemed to be using one of a row of machines which very efficiently printed our boarding cards and luggage labels. But when we went to the ""Bag Drop"" we were told to wait at the back of the queue. I'm still not sure if everybody in front of us had already checked in at the machine or not. The Jetstar staff member at check-in weighed our 4 hold cases. We'd paid for four x 20 kgs, but all of them only came to 70 kgs. We knew we were allowed 7 kgs per person for hand luggage. When we were asked to redistribute 2 kgs. weight from one case into other pieces of hand luggage which were underweight, we were shocked. We were 10 kgs under on hold baggage! A little common sense would show that we'd already paid more than enough for extra luggage. We'd flown Tigerair from Melbourne to Sydney and their luggage policy seemed far more reasonable - same weight restrictions but as long as the total does not exceed your limit it doesn't matter how it is distributed. Onboard we had serious problems with fellow passengers. We were seated together 27C my wife, 27D myself, 27E my daughter's boyfriend and 27F my daughter. There were 7 men aged 28-35ish seated 25C,D,E,F and 26D,E and F. They were very boisterous from the start, shouting and swearing at each other. Then they ordered beers repeatedly until one of the attendants refused to serve them more alcohol. They became more rowdy and then the one in 26F dropped a can of beer which rolled against my daughter's handbag. When she drew his attention to this they rounded on her giving her ""the finger"". I told them to be careful and they called me a ""rat"". The attendant came and asked them to calm down but it was having no effect. The ringleader appeared to be in 25F. He pressed the call button and told the attendant that I was annoying him by ""reading too loud"" he could ""hear my thoughts"". He looked at me and put his forked fingers to his eyes and then pointed them at me, in true Hollywood gangster style! I felt threatened and concerned for my family's well being. I was worried that they'd all come up to us at the baggage claim. As it happened the only thing was that 25F ran past and bumped into my arm on purpose. I feel the cabin crew allowed this situation to escalate. The entire rear of the plane had to put up with this childish behaviour for three hours. They even shouted at infants to 'Shush"". The staff should have threatened them with calling ahead to Cairns Airport Police to be waiting. This may have served to quieten them down.  Why can't Jetstar allow check-in earlier than 2 hours? I know I have done it with other airlines and it cuts down the queuing tremendously. Why don't Jetstar adopt a total weight luggage policy and show clearly if baggage drop is operational?

I was actually traveling from Vancouver to SYD, and broke up the trip by flying Air Canada YVR-HNL return for about $550, and the Jetstar for about $1100 (plus all the extras). I had to stay one night in HNL each way, adding $500 hotel. With the Jetstar extras the cost perhaps $500 less than a direct flight. Plus I was trying to break up the 15/16 hour nonstop flight duration.  Jetstar : I had a cordial reception checking in at HNL. The rest of the staff throughout the rest of the trip were indifferent. The Boeing 787 is a nice airplane, as they go. I paid extra for a good seat, which was a great boon on full flights. That was good value for money. I paid $40-ish for the meal: it was a rude joke both times. The meal was mushy, minimal and miserable, and you needed to wait 15 minutes for a drink to wash it down. The most demeaning part of the experience was getting dinged $125 for my 5 kilos overweight baggage on my return. There wasn't a weight scale where I was staying, so I couldn't have prepared myself for the problem. My carry-on backpack was at the carry-on weight limit, so I couldn't switch items into that. So it was either pay the money or toss out some of my clothes. I paid, and then fumed for the next hour or two. The only way Jetstar can avoid this kind of rude greeting for a customer would be to give staff some leeway on the overweight rule. But they were very stern. In most of the reviews people are willing to forgive Jetstar's faults because of the lower prices. I don't agree. A price is a price and a fault is a fault.

When we arrived check in had just opened and there were only 2 staff checking baggage. Got our baggage tag and got in the queue. Then they proceeded to call out every single passenger whose flight were departing before ours, regardless of where they were in the queue. At one point the front line stood still for more than 49 minutes whilst jet star personnel were pulling people out of the other lanes and getting them checked in. When we finally got seen - after a riot nearly broke out - the check in guy told us we had less than 5 minutes to get through security and make our flight. We had to run like mad. Our flight was at 6:05 am!  I don't care about the pay per use for extra stuff like bags, food, seat assignments etc - it's a nuisance but fine. I'll pay, as long as I get the service. The lack of a coordinated path to check baggage for passengers and poor organization at the airport is simply not acceptable and no cheap airfare makes this worth the anxiety! It is maddening and made me angry and resentful. I can't believe this airline is a Qantas offshoot. In the end don't bother with the 2 hours early part. It does not make any difference trust me!!

When the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip, the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. I reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of Business Class reclined to limited extent. This meant that I was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. The exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically, if you are on the sunrise-side of the craft, you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. Food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that I ate in a space of less than 30cms.

Tired frustrated customers then had to be insulted by the Jetstar spokesman who simply kept reiterating that any costs involved in missed forward flights, accommodation etc were our fault if we had not taken out travel insurance – he likened it to hiring a car. I researched 5 different travel insurance providers and none would insure against an airline cancelling their own flight only against weather. Jetstar did not reply to my query as to whether our flight was cancelled due to engineering problems and if so why wasn’t another aircraft provided or due to an unfilled flight which several passengers had been told was the reason. Jetstar did offer $60 vouchers with an expiry date of 6 months – I asked if these could be transferred or extended as we did not intend to travel in that period and of course the response was no. The cancelled flight caused many passengers grief, in our case it set the stage for a nightmare 5 days of missed ongoing flights with huge rebooking fees (being Easter it was a nightmare getting seats on flights), missed hire car bookings, missed hotel and car hire, lost luggage meaning the same clothes for 5 days. Jetstar customer service responded that 'Section 9.1 of our Conditions of Carriage does state that flight times do not form part of your contract of carriage with us. This information is available on our website and you agree to it when you make your booking.' Jetstar is not a cheap airline, in fact there are times it is more expensive than Qantas and Virgin – we booked Jetstar because it fitted in with our dates. United Airlines and Delta Airlines were both involved in our 5 missed flights and both were amazingly helpful in getting us from Honolulu to New York and even changed our flight for the second time without charge – why can’t Jetstar treat its passengers with the same consideration.

Excellent professional conduct by cabin crew. Aircraft was clean. We had seat 17E & 17D seats were comfortable. Cabin service was very efficient for this short flight. My only disgruntle with Jetstar is when doing you own online web check in if you want to change the seat you have been allocated you are charged $5 per person for a standard seat and more for a better seat such as wanting more leg room. This is the first time since I have been flying with Jetstar this has occurred. By doing my own online web check in I have actually saved Jetstar money by them not having to employ extra check in staff. I don't feel it is fair for the airline to charge extra for you wanting to choose your own seat. They never did this in the past. With the new 7kg carry on board luggage only rule if you are a female passengers be aware that if carrying on board luggage only they will weigh both your on board luggage and hand bag together. If you are over the 7kg limit with both items you will be charged extra. So if you are a female you will be disadvantaged as most women carry heavy hand bags.

As it was an evening flight we checked the Jetstar website throughout the day to ensure that our flight was not delayed before heading to the airport. On arrival at 3.30pm we were told the flight had been delayed until 4.00am. The reason was fog over Perth however we watched as other reputable airlines departed as scheduled. We were each given 'meal' vouchers which turned out to be to the value of approx. $7.15 - not enough to purchase a meal from any of the airport vendors. When we approached Jetstar for further compensation they did not provide any. We were forced to spend 12 hours waiting in Changi airport watching time pass. When the flight eventually did depart (after 4am following a long delay on the Tarmac) we were then brought the dinner meals that had been pre-purchased when we believed we would be flying out in the evening!

Bags were bang on 20kg if not a whisker over but a blind eye was shown which was a relief. They didn't weigh hand luggage at the gate. ADL-DPS sector was on a domestic A320 which was old dirty and the magazines in our seats were all torn. The seats were either developed by a bus builder or just stuffed judging by our numb behinds for the 5-hour flight. Crew fine and I gather ADL based. Disappointingly half the menu was unavailable as tragic as the choices are - they really aren't trying it really is lowest common denominator and undrinkable wine. DPS-MEL sector was on new B787 with Australian pilots but all Thai flight attendants. New Denpasar Airport is excellent very efficient even if the air con is a bit changeable. You can buy duty free (unlike other ports in Asia on flights to Aus?) which is bagged and given to you at the gate. First time on 787 and the big windows and nicer cabin humidity/pressure seemed to make a difference. I got a good sleep couldn't complain too much about seat or pitch.

Would not fly with them again unless it was very cheap just like their service. Can't believe Qantas own this very budget airline.

Flew Denpasar to Adelaide and as soon as I joined the check-in lines I was glad I'd booked my return trip on Virgin Australia. Queues at check-in were horrendous and the Melbourne flight had been cancelled so many of that flight's passengers were shifted onto the Adelaide flight. On board people can't pay cash for food and drink which seems ridiculous especially if they aim to save time. I was sat in the middle of the plane and they took over an hour to reach me and by the time they got to me they'd run out. When I asked for a fourth beer they stopped serving me because I'd ""had enough"" which is ridiculous given a) I was paying for it b) even a teetotaler wouldn't get intoxicated on four small cans of beer and c) their service had been lousy. If I go back to Adelaide next year I think I'll pay a premium to go with Singapore Airlines from Surabaya where I live even if I do have to backtrack and add 2 hours onto my journey because one doesn't get all these annoyances on full-service airlines that you get on these budget carriers.",1,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

Rubbish lolly wrappers under seat in front. Return flight cancellation announced on almost indecipherable loudspeaker only 10 mins before boarding time then flashed up on screen at Boarding Gate. Such late notice (none received by SMS) left many stranded and those with already checked in baggage unable to transfer to another airline in time. We were forced to sit at airport an additional 4 hours to be seated on their next plane. Staff claimed Captain had called in sick. Surely there are procedures in place for crew to be obliged to give more notice so standby crew if they have such a thing can be called in. To cap it off purported staff shortage on arrival at Tullamarine meant a further delay as cabin crew unable to open doors to allow already disgruntled passengers to disembark. No apologies. Not even an offer of a complimentary tea coffee or water in flight for those affected. Very bad PR. Don't try to speak to Senior Management about your experience or have them contact you - Jetstar claim they have no direct line. First and last time we travel with this airline.

Cramped cabin little leg room nickel and dimed for everything. Add to this the fact that the in seat power and overhead reading light wasn't working (despite a few reset attempts) and it added up to a fairly unremarkable experience. Jetstar has also changed their check in for international flights at MEL adding slick new kiosks which generate boarding passes and baggage tags. All well and good however there is no longer a separate queue for online check ins necessitating a long wait in the single check in queue. Absolutely no value to a customer to check in online now - don't waste your time.

When asked about how passengers could go about making claims or trying to find alternative flights out of Singapore Jetstar staff could only offer a measly piece of photocopied information sheet explaining that the flight was cancelled and that should passengers choose to find their own alternative flight carrier that this would mean Jetstar bears no responsibility in fully refunding claims.,3,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

Red-eye flight which was delayed by an hour departing 0035. This was our first flight with Jetstar in business class but paid for with QFF points (classic award). This apparently meant no entitlement to lounge access at Denpasar as ticket class was insufficient +/- we hadn't requested lounge access? (Had no idea we were meant to). This was an unhappy start to the flight as we'd been hanging out for a shower after a long day in Bali. Initial impression favourable staff friendly. Drinks offered and delivered promptly food order taken. Downhill from there. Partner's meal failed to materialise - seemed like everyone was getting meals in dribs and drabs (low staffing numbers?) so we kept waiting. Gave up when we realised staff had disappeared and cabin was asleep for the night. (Yes could have followed up but we were dead on our feet and preferred to sleep). The food I received was tasteless - carrot soup with a really rubbish bread roll. Cheesecake ok. No offers of drinks when meal delivered - we'd been asked pre takeoff if we'd want drinks after takeoff and we'd declined - no opportunity to change our mind. Seats were horrible (Dreamliner 787). Hard pitiful foot rests (worse than no foot rest frankly) limited recline and difficult to achieve. Sleep was fitful and uncomfortable. Black blankets left black fluff over our clothes. No pillow only blow up neck rest in comfort packs. Entertainment system (screen in armrest) and headphones ok but choices limited compared to other airlines.

The moment I got into my seat I was taken down ""memory lane"" of the 1990's. The seat of Jetstar's Business Class was exactly the same seat taken when you're flying Business Class in the 1990's. The only thing that was added were the two in-seat power points. Makes me suspect that Jetstar/Qantas cut corners by re-using the old Business Class seats from old airframes and installed them here. Like the old Business Class seats the in-flight entertainment (IFE) is a very bulky iPad with equally bulky battery pack. The first meal dinner I was given a choice of two dishes. After dinner I ordered for black coffee 15 minutes later my ordered arrived as coffee with milk/coffee. I ordered Scotch after dinner and it arrived 20 minutes later as Scotch and soda. For breakfast I was given two choices: Take it or leave it. This is where Jetstar cuts costs again. Instead of hot meal you're given a bowl of cereals. The seats were hard and I didn't sleep a wink because it was just plain difficult to lean back. Personally I wouldn't recommend anyone to bother buying Business Class as it is really not worth it. I have flown Business Class (Cathay Pacific) and Premium Economy (Air New Zealand) and Jetstar's Business Class is BELOW (in standard) compared to Air New Zealand's Premium Economy.

The cabin crew also burnt the coffee which stunk out the entire cabin. Luckily for us this flight did get us in to Melbourne 8 hours earlier than we had first booked so a small positive to say the least. On our return journey from Melbourne to Perth - only four days later - we were due to board the plane having been called over the speaker to get our boarding passes ready to then be told over the speaker that ""we think the plane has been cancelled."" We had to quickly run out to the departure check in grab our checked in bags off the carousel and attempt to be rebooked onto another flight. Thankfully we were changed to a flight (operated by Qantas) to Perth via Adelaide with an extra waiting time of 2 hours in Melbourne airport. Again things turned out well for us given you get IFE on Qantas flights and food/drinks are included however this experience really does remind us that paying the extra cash for an airline Virgin Australia or Qantas is much more reliable. I'm all for flying cheap airlines but this experience was a joke how can one airline have so many problems in four days? Not once did we receive a sincere apology from Jetstar flight.",1,1,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

I have just returned from a holiday to Bali and flew Jetstar. I was actually quite excited to be flying the 787 for the first time after all the hype about comfort air quality bigger windows and low noise levels. What an enormous disappointment. Jetstar have managed to take such an advanced and modern aircraft and jam it with cramped seats down in economy with terrible leg room. I am not even that big 175cm. It looks like they had a team from Tupperware design and install the entire interior of this plane. Plastic everywhere. The food (pre-purchased) was marginal at best and it'll cost you $10 to watch a movie. You go to all that trouble of installing screens in the back of the seat and it seemed hardly anyone bothered paying. The actual inflight experience (bigger windows air quality and smooth flight) was OK - and I am looking forward to flying the 787 again with an airline that actually designed a cabin with a hint of passenger comfort in mind. Thankfully it's only a 6 hour run up to Bali and slightly shorter coming home. Honestly Qantas Group - you should have kept the Dreamliner for the 'nicer' brand - and given you old bangers to 'little brother' Jetstar.,1,1,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

I chose business class and left the flight feeling that the customer care food and cabin comfort was good. The food which was better than previous flights. My return flight JQ23 from MEL to Tokyo NRT - a very disappointing experience in 20 years of business travel. Check-in was the best customer handling that I had experienced with Jetstar. Two hours later at the gate the boarding process was mismanaged and turned into a stampede of economy and business class passengers jostling for access at the same time. Staff were flustered and lost control. The cabin crew communication customer handling and courtesy was very good. I appreciated their efforts and acknowledge that Jetstar standards has improved. The worst Business Class meal - 3 choices chicken and noodle pea and cheese soup or Hamburger ""raked"" sliced pork. The meal arrived - the hamburger was a dry reheated toasted sandwich with two pickles and mustard. Not a hamburger. One thin slice of pork between soggy reheated toast and pickles. This was not an optional snack this was the main course standard for business class. It gets worse the desert was two shortbread cookies and no tea or coffee. The breakfast was good with fruit yoghurt juice. I requested tea which was cold. I hadn't realised that Jetstar had included an inflatable neck cushion in the the comfort pack - a thoughtful and beneficial improvement however when I tried to brush my teeth before landing the tooth paste was missing and there was no paper cups in the toilet. These basic products are important. I can't brush my teeth so the comfort pack became ineffective. Jetstar is a budget airline it is not Singapore Airlines so fair assessment is needed considering value-for-money. Jetstar has made many improvements with cabin crew and ground staff customer handling skills. As I confirmed in my flight ex-Japan Jetstar can provide good food that meets business class expectations. However the toasted sandwich and cookies main course has me questioning whether my next flight to Australia in August should be with another airline. Jetstar's weak point - it cannot sustain a basic standard the difference between the two flight experiences was huge.

Then there would be some point to checking in at home. The long queue that I had to join included both people who had already checked in and others who hadn't. After being called out of the queue to catch my plane there was a long wait in the airless dungeon that passes for Jetstar's terminal - then a late gate change which led us back into the Qantas terminal -- and then a long motionless queue with no information. Finally we were able to board around 30 minutes late. Once on the plane the journey was fine. The seat was comfortable and the service was friendly. There was a long wait at Hobart for luggage probably due to the arrival of another Jetstar aircraft minutes before ours. The return journey could not have been more different. Quick efficient check-in and boarding a comfortable seat (I was offered an exit row seat at check-in) and arrival in Melbourne 20 minutes early.

Overall I would describe the experience as mediocre. We were in economy and walking through business class I would not pay the extra for what looked like a sub par business class offering. The seats were okay but what you would expect on a domestic flight not a long haul international flight. It was a night flight so people were wanting to try and sleep. In the row behind us were four off duty Qantas flight attendants who proceeded to drink to excess talk extremely loudly and swear constantly disturbing other passengers for at least four hours. The flight attendants on our flight took about 5 hours to finally tell them to quieten down. I was astounded that they thought it was okay to disturb other passengers for hours on end. Appalling behaviour that should have been pulled up sooner. Inflight entertainment is non existent on back of seats which is ridiculous. You can rent Ipads for $18 which were woeful. The limited range of movies seemed to be geared towards the male audience. Even the lifestyle section was a selection of cars and music shows. They really need to take a good look at this very limited and poor offering. We heard many fellow passengers complaining about the Ipad content also. Food was either pre booked and very expensive meals or snacks you could buy on board. Take your own food on board would be my advice.

The flight from Darwin to Sydney left about 2am. A family we made friends with while waiting in the queue suffered worse than us. They were put off the plane at Darwin because their baby had eczema around it's mouth. Wasn't the whole family just the father and 3 kids. Mother was waiting for them in Sydney. The pilot said the family was removed because the child had an obvious illness. I witnessed the whole event and the pilot never left the cockpit. Anyone that has had a child with eczema would have known what it was. so anyway the family was taken off the plane and left on the bridge.

They were disorganised we didn't get a veg meal that we had ordered. The cabin was an absolute pigsty too - there was an overwhelming smell of urine there were coffee drips on my tray table milk spilt over the seat a carton of milk shoved down the side of the seat previous passengers' rubbish in the seatback compartment. I took my daughter to the toilet about 10 minutes after the seatbelt sign had been switched off and there was urine on the floor. We got back to SYD late and we missed our connecting flight. I had tried twice before leaving HNL to check in online it wouldn't let me. Tried again before going through customs wouldn't let me. I then called once we had got though customs talked to someone who told me she should be able to get it done. I asked her if she could let me know the quickest way to get to domestic and she said she could then put me on hold. Very long story short I ended up on the phone to her for 38 minutes got to check in 29 minutes before takeoff and was not allowed on the plane. I have travelled with Jetstar many times and at this stage the bad experiences outnumber the good about 3-1. Last time on a flight from HBA to MLB I organised (booked and paid for) transport via Jetstar and ended up at the airport with the company having no record of it and refusing to pick me up. The thing that I think frustrates me the most is that through all this it has been me who has had to chase everything up. Had we had decent communication and correct answers it would have been manageable.,3,3,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

Last year I experienced a 4 hour delay in Melbourne on my return trip to Sydney which they blamed initially on mechanical trouble and a further plethora of excuses which I just tolerated at the time. Yesterday October 13th 2014 I copped another dose of Jetstars incompetence and attitude to its passengers. Supposed flying JQ413 at3pm to Sydney - arrived at 2pm. At 2.30pm an announcement made that the flight was cancelled (with no explanation) and that we were to be bussed 100km to Brisbane to join JQ817 to Sydney which didn't depart until 6.30pm. So instead of being home in Sydney at 5.30 pm we got there at 9.20 pm 4 hours late. Totally unacceptable. They don't provide proper service to their customers and as far as Im concerned I will never fly Jetstar again.,3,1,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

You get what you pay for with this airline. Flew round trip from Tokyo to Fukuoka. The departure was fine nothing too major besides the language barrier. The return trip-was hell. I arrived at the airport and checked into the terminal at 1pm for a 2:30 flight. At 2 pm the notification was released that this flight and only this flight was to be postponed for 3 hours due to weather that was scheduled to arrive later that night. Why would you delay a flight so that it departs when weather turns bad vs while it's nice and sunny? I went to the ticket counter to enquire about being moved to the next available flight out and of course the next flights to my destination are on time and full. Great. So now my 2.30 departure is now a 5pm departure while all other airlines are on schedule. he attendant says I am more than welcome to book an earlier fight with a different carrier and will be refunded part of my trip - I was 'credited' 92USD not even close to half of the cost of the total trip but it was a refund. I proceed to a different carrier and walk away at the $430 one way option and sadly go back the original carrier after the prices were higher at each different carrier. I purchased the only flight to my destination for $115 - the only open and next available flight. I paid for the same seat twice. I have a seat on a plane that once again is delayed. The departure is pushed to 8pm. While 2 flights to my destination from the same carrier leaving the same terminal are not delayed.,0,1,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

Airbus 320 both ways. Delays but I was informed early (SMS and email) and eventually in both cases - offered even better departure times as compared to what I was booked for. Staff nicely dressed in fresh youth style with black T-shirts (with discrete logo) and trousers. They were fast alert smiling and very friendly despite the flight was full to the very last seat. This is a LCC without free onboard service - but prices are low e.g. a hot meal (4 options) is 3 dollars inc. soft drink. The giftshop onboard offers e.g. colourful ladybags with airline logos for 4 USD. Jetstar depends on bus transfers in both airports as LCC carriers obviously do not get access the direct boarding/disembarkation gates.,4,1,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

Jetstar were almost obsessive about punctuality and to their credit these 4 flights were either right on time or earlier. The aircraft were all clean staff appeared friendly and helpful. Most enjoyable flights that met my expectations. Only thing is the seats are nearly always so hard that my backside becomes numb. Thousands of pax sitting for hrs on these seats soon destroys much of their cushioning. I never buy onboard. Bring my own food and bottled water. Here in New Zealand we regularly travel CHC- AKL-CHC and only use Jetstar. Punctual good fares and we are always satisfied in every way.

256513,2014-10-12,G Cook,False,Not specified,Economy Class,Not specified,Not specified,4,5,0,3,no,Jetstar Airways customer review,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary. Next time we pay more and fly with anyone but Jetstar.,0,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

Then we could not take off due to Narita being closed after 11pm - again fair enough. Captain very apologetic. That was nice. All passengers had to disembark retrace their steps through immigration and pick up their luggage - again fair enough I suppose. But then the whole planeload of passengers was left milling around trying to find out what was going to happen from a couple of harassed young Japanese Jetstar employees with limited English who were doing their level best in the face of increasingly bewildered and irritated passengers. After an hour or so news filtered through that there would be another flight late the following day. Eventually someone must have found the key to the room where the public address microphone is but no accommodation arranged or suggested and a couple of hundred people with all their bags simply left to their own devices in a deserted terminal in the middle of the night. Delays happen of course they do but you need a contingency plan for occasions such as these - and invest in a bullhorn for heavens sake so that you can keep people informed.

I had a glass of Royal Chivers and the attendant made sure it was topped up necessitating an afternoon nana nap! A late afternoon snack of warm beef foccacia sandwich before getting into Tokyo was also excellent. Only gripe is the footrests are low and on the night return flight I would prefer the legs more elevated. However value for money one can't complain.

How does one start with Jetstar International? Firstly the Thai crew are excellent and are far superior to the domestic version in Australia. The aircraft was on time and was a comfortable flight from an engineering perspective. However the interior of this aircraft can only be described as a time capsule whereby the interior designer had a selection of interiors and said ""That's the one - the theme we will go for is recycled 1970's Estonian disco."" To be fair not all of the seats were broken mine reclined on the left side thereby putting my left shoulder on the lap of the person behind me while my right shoulder was touching the back of the seat in front of me. I especially liked the rips in the ""leather"" that allowed me to hang my mobile phone for viewing of videos. Very thoughtful. Also the 3 TV's that came with the plane at the front of interior did not work so we couldn't even follow a flight map. On the return leg same story re interior.

Business is little better than economy with the seats in front dropping back into our laps - very little room. Worse was the return flight which Jetstar cancelled a few hours before departure. The email told us to phone an Australian customer service number (our cost) and we were told we had been moved to business on Virgin the following afternoon. When we checked in at Virgin we were told Jetstar had downgraded us to economy. After much argument with the Jetstar representative at the airport where the only options offered were to fly to Perth or Sydney they magically found two business class seats on that night's flight direct to Brisbane. We had to sit around at the airport for 10 hours. This was the first and last time I will fly Jetstar. My advice to fellow travellers is never fly Jetstar.

Once we were on the plane the pilot needed to get the weights and the flight crew needed to remember where meal customers were seated so they prohibited seat changing. Very poor customer service by airport staff! Flight: The seats were actually very comfortable. My intention was to sleep through the flight. Unfortunately my ticket said meal on it unbeknownst to me so 2 hours into my sleep the flight attendant jabbed my arm to wake me up and give me the food. Her exact words? ""You ordered the meal."" As we were landing the flight crew (not the pilot) made an announcement to thank us for flying and finally apologized for the delayed time. All in all - not the best experience. The food was good. The IPAD rental is ridiculously expensive and from what I heard doesn't offer a lot of selection. The flight attendants seems rushed or irritated when they did their jobs.

We could not check in until 6pm. The least Jetstar can offer is some bottled water and increase the meal voucher which is less than Aus$10. To hang around with luggage for so many hours at terminal 1 is not fun at all and an inconvenience.

Boarding: There was a business class first call. However despite 2 doors economy marched through the business cabin. It is an economy airline. No great fuss and we were up and away. On the plane: After some tine refreshments were served and cleared. Up in the air: Orders taken for meals and immigration cards out and with no great rush a hot towel arrived. Cruising: Drink served and soon the meal which was pretty good appeared. Cheese and wafers and fruit and a glass of lovely Rutherglen muscadelle were great. Inflight service: Once ""service"" is over staff become very scarce and those who are about do not overtly seek eye contact. However a walk into the galley is greeted warmly and efficiently for any small request. Inflight crew: The captain and second were good on announcements and I look forward to having them up front again. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous but you felt that was the extent of the service offering. I was sitting next to an off duty staff member and was not greeted with a hello or any form of inquiry as to my flight for the duration of the flight. I suppose that is what separates the great airlines from the good airlines? If you love your product or just go to work is demonstrated by behaviours not platitudes of company jingles.

First trip on the 'Dreamliner' which might as well be named 'Nightmareliner'. I found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from Jetstar's A330 which are generally appalling. I found the seats and aisles to be tight. Quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. Seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept 'kneeing' me the entire flight - suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. The IFE looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical Jetstar manner you pay for it. The 'mood lighting' and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. There is also some serious 'disinformation that Jetstar should retract - they claim there is 'shared seat power' on the aircraft. I didn't see it in my seat and when I asked the FA he said only the exit rows have it. There is a USB connector for PEDs but no shared in seat power. It is another example of Jetstar's notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. As for the flight it was on time out of MEL and early into BKK so credit to Jetstar for that. Crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for Jetstar. Summary: neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner.

We checked in with no dramas and we boarded and flew out exactly on time. Once seated however I discovered that a mother and two young children aged around 4 and 6 years were seated behind me and the youngest child started to kick the back of my seat pull the tray up and down and make a fair amount of noise bickering with the other child. I put up with it until after takeoff before getting the attention of a flight attendant. I explained the situation to her quietly so as not to offend anyone and we were moved to a seat at the back of the plane immediately no questions asked. I can appreciate that it is difficult for children to sit still when flying but I was not looking forward to having my seat kicked for 2.5 hours and I was grateful that flight staff on Jetstar were able to move us quickly and without fuss.

First flight on a 787 and booked my normal 1F. At check in advised it was one 1 E. Due to language difficulties I could not understand why and my request for an explanation was polite but I was not able to master the meaning. I was informed it was a window seat so proceeded to the aircraft. I was then advised that I was in the second row. The reason I fly in row one is for the legroom and lack of a seat in my face for 9 hours making laptop use at times impossible. Again the explanation was difficult to understand and upon my insistence I eventually got back into 1F. It appears the IFE was U/S in seat 1F and the crew were trying to assist me. Lived without IFE. Food and service very good from an all Thai crew which is becoming the norm on this leg and JQ 29. Big drawback with the 787 in seat 1F is that the galley access is out of alignment with the seat so approximately one foot of the space in front of the seat is in line with the open galley. This means when the crew make their multiple visits the curtain hits the passengers legs. This could be some what alleviated with a retainer lower down the curtain. So for 787 flights I advise I will be sitting in 1B or 1J which are out of the way of the traffic flow by about 4 inches. The seats were reasonably comfortable with reasonable recline but footrests need improving as the rung like support is intrusive. Plane new and clean as you would expect. PA from flight deck was nearly indecipherable. This is a safety issue that needs attending to. The headset issued now has a 3 pin plug and subjectively the headsets don't seem as noise cancelling as the ones on the A330. A pity my Bose were in checked luggage as the 3 pin plug would not worth the headset with my phone or Ipad so no IFE and no music.

Travelled with two bags which totaled 35 kg - ie: 15 kg over the allowance and the equivalent of a second bag. Jetstar charged me $300 for the excess luggage which was three times the price of the ticket and about ten times the price of what most global airlines charge for a second bag. Qantas should be reprimanded for selling Jetstar tickets and not informing customers about these usurious charges and Jetstar should be faulted for outright price gouging which doesn't remotely reflect the incremental cost of carrying the bag. Qantas customer service people in Melbourne washed their hands of the problem saying it is a Jetstar issue (even though JQ is owned by QF and the ticket was bought on the QF website).

Fly Silk is my advice until they have got their act together or fail which may not be far off looking at the way they seem to be going. Sadly we thought it was Emirates but it must have been a shared flight with Qantas. Oh well never again sorry Qantas.,1,1,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

No mention of needing to pre-book ipads. The inflight magazine even advertised to contact your friendly flight attendant if you would like to hire an ipad. We couldn't find a friendly flight attendant and they had no ipads available for anyone who hadn't pre-booked and paid at the time of ticketing. We even had looked on the website a few days before the flight and pre-ordered the comfort package (which was useless) and there was no mention of pre-booking ipads. Approx. 75% of the plane load did not have ipads and many like us wanted them so we were not the only passengers enduring the boring flight. Does Jetstar think it is acceptable to provide zero entertainment for an 11 hour flight? We did not pre-book the food package as we were of the opinion that we could buy food on board. Unfortunately most of the available food options were poor and ran out less than half way down the plane in the first serving (we were near the back). No pies no ham and cheese toasties. The male flight attendant was somewhat rude to a number of passengers and not sympathetic at all just saying you needed to pre-book. Perhaps they were just as bored and frustrated as the passengers. I would assume Jetstar wants to make as much money as possible and this would include hiring as many ipads as possible and selling as much food as possible to bored and hungry passengers?

I flew on 2 May from Perth to Bangkok. The trouble was I took an aspirin 10 minutes after takeoff and asked for a water. I was told it cost $4 cash. All I had was my ATM card. Four dollars: for a bottle of water on a 5 hour flight. Then I noticed I was sitting on a stripped Airbus that could easily pass for a re-purposed 1971 Trailways bus. No video entertainment zero amenities - 5 hours with nothing to do. I am sure Jetstar would install pay toilets if they could.

It cost my group members over $800 each to fly from Singapore to Hangzhou when tickets on full-fledge flights with meals refreshments and entertainment on other airlines like SIA and Cathay Pacific can cost less. It's 'budget' quality in seats with very narrow leg space so the flight attendants insisted that all hand carry had to be stored in the overhead compartments. Problem is that all the compartments near our seats were full with the crew's and other passengers luggage. There didn't seem to be restrictions on the size and the number of hand-carry passengers could bring on the plane. A crew member offered to squeeze my backpack into a compartment that was far from my seat. As I had my passport and money in it it refused to have it out of my sight.

Had flown on Qatar's 787 Business Class so had high expectation leading into this flight and was disappointed. Seat 1F - which was in a row of 3 when I checked in on-line the seats next to me were free but at check-in they agent advised these seats were now taken. I had asked if I could move to 3G/H but was told these were reserved for crew! I had read online that these were the best seats with more recline what's the point of having them if they are only for crew - seems pointless! Seat config of 2-3-2. For business class I don't understand the point of a row of 3 seats. Seat comfort was ok but impossible to sleep in. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Dinner was ok - Soup for starter which was tasteless Main was very tasty which was stir fry steak. Was accompanied with a 'salad' which was a couple of lettuce leaves in a bowl. Wine choice good. Entertainment system ok - had a couple of new release movies and some recent TV shows but quite limited. Overall it was good value for money but I'd hardly call this Business Class. I don't see why Jetstar wouldn't invest in putting in slightly bigger seats with more recline especially when the majority of their flights on the way back to Australia are red eye and the current seats are impossible to sleep in comfortably.,3,3,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

I don't usually purchase food as I am sure I can survive for 2.5 hrs. The fares were all cheap easy to book and are good value. As always you get what you pay for. I rarely take luggage so the fare structure suits me and I always pay via Direct Debit to save on Credit Card Fees.

However the leg room and recline were quite limited and the leg rest on my seat did not work. Chief FA looked at it and pronounced the cable broken ""like lots of these seats"" offered no regrets but pointed to 2 company non-revs in the bulkhead row and asked if I wanted her to go and roust them out so I could sit there. I felt very much put on the spot and declined. Miserable night. I suppose I should have been more assertive. On the inbound: execrable vegetarian food in economy and the seats also busted: no reading light no call bell no expression of regret from cabin staff (and this was an exit row seat for which I had paid extra). A332 on both flights very dirty and shabby. The toilets on both were simply disgusting even at the start of each flight. Many FAs wore dirty or tattered uniforms with buttons missing and frayed hems and cuffs.

Budget Airline means no frills and the bare basics unless you want to pay extra. As it is only a 3.5 hour flight I was more than happy to forgo the full services offered in exchange for a much cheaper fare. Both times Jetstar have provided a realistic service for the price paid. Aircraft was clean flight on time and fairly smooth. No real complaints.

I paid $39 for Sydney to Melbourne (Avalon) and it was money well spent considering the alternative flights at the same time with other airlines to Melbourne (Tullamarine) were much more expensive. The flight was a good example of what a LCC should be. On time departure and arrival friendly crew a clean A320 and surprisingly comfortable seats. I am 180cm and my knees were not touching the seat in front perhaps due to the clever re-positioning of the magazine pocket to the top of the seat-back above the meal tray.

Checked with online Jetstar staff who assured me vouchers were valid. After 8 more attempts gave up and booked on phone. In the end the overall cost went up by approx $185 thus cancelling out vouchers. Probably would not have travelled with them as they worked out to be not much cheaper than other airlines after the 'voucher' debacle. What can I say the staff do the best they can but all in all very badly run. The food is average with very small selection the seats are uncomfortable and not particularly clean.

Signs were bad to start with when the check in area at Tullamarine was shambolic with enormous queues and no bag drop operating. Eventually made it to the downstairs departure lounge and queued at the allocated gate only to find at the last minute that the gate had changed with no announcement which left about 50 passengers scrambling through the terminal to catch the flight. With the doors shut plane then sat at the departure gate for 25 minutes with no advice or announcements about the reason for the delay and how it would effect our arrival time. When the flight finally departed about a third of the in flight snack menu was unavailable and the attendants were unable to accept foreign currency despite us receiving an unsolicited email from Jetstar 2 days earlier explaining that foreign currencies were accepted on this flight. With a budget airline like Jetstar the customer needs to have budget expectations but its no excuse for the airline not misinform passengers and stuff them around.

This trip the flight I was departing on has been cancelled and I was offered a flight approximately 4 hours earlier. Since this was not possible due to other commitments and anything offered resulted in me missing the event I was travelling for I asked for a refund.

Bag drop at Melbourne was a slow process. About 50 people in line and only 4 of the 12 desks operating. When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30. The Jetstar Melbourne departure area resembles a bus station and has too few seats for the passengers waiting to board their flights. Pushback for the full flight was at 11.00 and the cabin crew very efficient announcements could be clearly heard and service was friendly and efficient. Despite the aircraft being on the ground for a good 35 minutes most of the windows were grubby. The flight was fine and I had about 2cm between my knees and the seat in front. Thankfully they didn't recline the seat. A 15 minute delay in Sydney waiting for a clear air-bridge and a 20 minute wait to collect our bags capped off an uneventful flight.,3,0,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

For a flight of only 6.5 hours the crew took 2 hours 45 mins to serve drinks/dinner and 1.5 hours to serve breakfast. Bear in mind that this is a low cost airline and meals etc are only provided to those who are prepared to pay at the time of serving. I took a good look at the number of passengers who did purchase meals and there were not many therefore the serving times should have been a lot faster than they were. In between serving the crew made no attempt to contain their noise coming from the galley. Probably the most disruptive flight I have been on and for a change it was not the passengers who were the cause. Perhaps a review of the serving processes is required to help speed this up.

We sought legroom and we got it. The seat width was suitable. We needed a wheelchair and ‘pusher’ at all travel terminal areas as they had slopes difficult joining lips & pushing distances beyond what I am capable of doing. Jetstar assisted with a wheelchair on the outward leg. Only after much discussion did we get 'pusher' assistance on arrival in Singapore. When this came it was an excellent 'local service' - a gratuity was not begrudged. For frequent travellers being a continuing Qantas Club member as I am was wise. In Singapore they arranged the 'pusher' service to our return gate. Sadly at both check-ins knowledge by Jetstar staff about Business Class Max rights plus those of Qantas Club Members was either nil or misinformed. It was a bad start later righted by Qantas Club Staff at both lounges. The in light food choices were acceptable. No problems with the complimentary liquor nor level of service table decor or travel amenities supplied. Seat back lowering by the person in front was a concern on both flights as we had to disturb those persons when we wished to move about. Our outward seats were in Row 6 – the last in Business Class with restricted but acceptable lowering for a day flight not suitable if overnight. The Jetstar web-site would not let me pre-select a seat if you had asked for ‘wheelchair assistance’ as we had - it was one or the other and this is unsatisfactory. On return I opted to select Row 4 to fully recline. In this position the seat is not a fully reclining ‘sleeper’- footrest space is insufficient. With a 2-3-2 configuration in this cabin I would not choose the middle seat of a fully occupied ‘3’. We were fortunate both ways in not having a full cabin thus no problem with overhead storage but a number of the compartments were taken up with staff bags and service items-not good. Ours were Jetstar stop-over flights in Singapore as part of flying to/from China thus and correctly there were helpful Chinese & English speaking flight attendants however the level of English could have been better. In reading some of the adverse comments about Jetstar Business the benefits provided compared to cost is being ignored. It is a precious approach to compare Jetstar to a 'full service' airline.

Given the fault was theirs they should have made at least some effort to be more helpful. We couldn't check in our luggage because the paperwork wasn't done.

There is so little room between the rows that when the passenger in front has his seat reclined it is almost impossible to leave your seat! On a short daytime flight perhaps but on an overnight flight sleep is impossible. The food was however quite good and the alcohol service OK but nothing makes up for uncomfortable seating or the lack of pillows (unbelievable even though they provide a blow-up neck support).

We are Qantas Club members (corporate) and only have one real complaint about Jetstar. We are able to access the Qantas Club lounge but cannot use the Qantas Club check in facilities. The queues at Melbourne and Sydney terminal 2 are notoriously long and while we all stand there waiting with people stressing and Jetstar staff running up and down the line calling passengers to counters for 'called flights' the adjacent Qantas check in counters (especially the dedicated Qantas Club ones) are empty with staff having lovely personal chats. Why doesn't Qantas Group either use these under utilised counters and check Qantas Club members in or create a dedicated Jetstar queue for these premium passengers instead of constantly annoying us by making us wait for ages. Surely it wouldn't cost too much to implement and would be a fantastic customer service to an already pretty good airline. Just because it's a 'low cost' doesn't mean premium passengers should be treated in a low cost fashion. Also I thought 'leisure airline' was the preferred term for Jetstar - perception is very powerful. Tiger is 'low cost'.,4,4,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

Went through customs told the flight information on our boarding passes was wrong - incorrect flight number! The board had a gate but no time! We went to the gate and found other people some of whom had received text messages saying that the flight was delayed until 14.45 or 4.45.

Then we were given - reluctantly - $10 vouchers to keep us fed and watered for the next 5.5 hours. Had we been told this at check-in we would have bought passes to the lounge so we could have waited in comfort. Jetstar don't allow their vouchers to be used towards the cost of the lounge which is ridiculous. When we finally boarded the flight crew had the audacity to ask us to hurry so they wouldn't be delayed!

Very little difference to what companions were given in economy class. Bland tasteless muck. We did have metal cutlery! Once the meal was served the attendants seamed to disappear and even getting a fresh bottled water was a chore. I'm not convinced the extra cost over economy is actually good value. The seats are comfortable if you're above average height and you do get off the flight first upon arrival making it quicker at immigration. overall though I think they need to lift their game. In their favour I did think the food quality was better on the Sydney to Thailand leg maybe they need to look at the suppliers in Thailand?,2,3,0,Not specified,Jetstar Airways

This means check-in counter staff are idle until each flight opens - then bombarded - by the people who are all waiting just outside the check in queue anyway. They usually don't use air- bridges so you have to walk in the weather across the tarmac. You kind of expect that on a little Dash-8 at a regional airport - but not on a big jet in a capital city. As per Jetstar website seat pitch on the A320 is 28"" - not 30"". All other Aussie airlines have 30-33"". That makes a big difference on a 5.2hr flight BNE-PER. Seats only recline about 4 degrees back as a result. You can't even get a drink of water for less than $3.50. No room in overhead lockers because they're full of carry-on luggage from those who won't pay $18 for checked luggage - but will happily pay for numerous $7 bourbons en-route. You can't move to spare seats because they are sold to someone. The worst aspect: You can't check your bags through on multiple domestic flights (only on some international). You have to get your bags after each flight and then re-check for the next flight and re-clear security.

Overall, the service was acceptable but of a somewhat lower quality than the other airline. Firstly, the planes are dated and started showing their age. The inflight entertainment system (BOG-SCL) is not very reliable. The touchable screen does not work well while the entertainment system wired control is in the seat, and any wrong body movement in the seat might cause its acting by itself. Besides, there is no power outlet either. Since I am accustomed to use my flight time to work, on this occasion I was disappointed that it was not possible because my computer’s battery died out quickly. On another note, the staff is doing their work but as many other reviews here have noted it is rather cold and not exactly very smiley. Half of my flights had been delayed though apparently due to the weather issue or airport traffic beyond the airline control. Yet, I almost missed my connection in Santiago because the luggage delivery was late, while the airport international arriving area is small and crowded and there is a long line for customs. Only half the time the boarding is done by turns (according to the rows of seats assigned), when it is enforced is very convenient. What stands out, however, is the quality of food provided on the longer legs in economy - quite tasty, with metal and not plastic fork and knife used. Unlimited and good quality wine and other spirits. However, there is not even a glass of water offered on the domestic Bogota to Cali flight.

The meal trolley only just fits through. The tray table is also very small. On the return leg, a passenger fell ill immediately after takeoff. The crew managed this very well. About 2 hours into the flight, it was determined that we'd have to return to SCL. The airline put us into hotels. As a transit passenger through SCL, the airline arranged to pay our reciprocity fee (US$100) to enter into Chile. This was a long process (over 1 hour) but at least they paid for it. The airline wasn't able to arrange a single large bus to take us to the hotel at the last minute and so there was another long process (about 1.5 hours) of getting all of us into separate mini buses. The hotel was excellent and included free food. Back to the airport, this time in a big coach and a very long check-in process. Our bags were checked through to SYD, and we were advised we'd been put onto a Qantas flight from AKL to SYD. The flight was again reasonable - good crew, OK food (definitely not up to Emirates standards) and bathrooms kept clean. Due to our delayed arrival into AKL, we had to overnight there, and again LAN had arranged a hotel, meal and bus transfer for us. Overall, LAN managed this stressful situation which was out of their control quite well, ensuring we had a place to rest and food to eat and made sure we all got to our final destinations.

Santiago-Bogota LA574 (8 April - 767 I think, older plane). Cabin crew and attendants were excellent, professional and attentive throughout this flight. LAN need to speed up the maintenance/replacement of planes on longer internal routes. Plane issues - Twice before takeoff/taxing the overhead locker dropped open. Upon takeoff the foot locker of an adjacent seat fell open. An air-conditioning section dropped down and had to be taped up with ""gaffer tape"", I had issues with the electric seat and controls which did not initially respond due to the age of the equipment and gears not catching. I had to replace the headset as reception was scratchy and then when done if I bumped the section where the plug connected with the seat then it would switch the volume to the loudest level.

Cabin crew continued on a similar theme from the other flights, all were excellent, helpful and professional throughout the flight as was the crew from NZ to Sydney. Best Points - Quality of the Dreamliner and the flight. Professionalism, friendliness, attentiveness of Cabin crew/attendants throughout all legs.

We finally managed to get someone's attention in the end who arranged to put us on an alternative flight (Aerolineas Argentinas) almost 12 hours later the same day. It is worthy to note that as a result of the airline staff incompetency, we have missed two potential flights bound for Buenos Aires while waiting for a response. I have since raised a request via LAN website to provide a written notice to confirm the cancellation. Unsurprisingly I have not heard back from the airline. It took them over 10 days to acknowledge receipt of my request. It will apparently take them another 30 days to assign the case to someone.

My husband and I have flown internationally with LAN on three occasions, and each time our flight has been delayed - twice by 5 hours, and once by 16 hours! On each occasion, we have found LAN ground staff to be unhelpful and uncommunicative. On the most recent occasion, we were told that the delay was due to the fact that there were 50 more passengers booked on the flight than the plane they were using could accommodate. The ground staff's attempts at resolving the problem were a display of incompetence, and the whole process turned into an absolute debacle. Although several of the ground staff could speak fluent English, they refused to communicate or make announcements in any language other than Spanish (despite the fact that the majority of passengers on the flight were English-speaking Australians and new Zealanders). This has also been the case during our previous experiences with LAN ground staff. When my husband and I attempted to board, we were told to join a queue of 'rejected' passengers and wait for our fate to be decided. When we eventually reached the front of the queue, I asked that we be allocated seats next to each other. This appeared to enrage the staff member allocating seats, as she pushed us aside and proceeded to completely ignore us, continuing to allocate seats to people who had been in the queue behind us. When we tried to get her to communicate with us, she continued to ignore us, and laughed and joked with a person she was speaking to on the phone. By this time, there was almost nobody left in the queue, and I was becoming extremely distressed and anxious. This only appeared to cause the staff member further amusement. Eventually, my husband managed to get the attention of another ground staff member, who came and took over the computer and allocated us two seats within a few seconds. We boarded the by now almost-full plane only to find that the new seats we had been allocated were already occupied, and the only empty seats were the two that we had originally been allocated!

We were travelling with a 5 month old baby. My complaints about LAN Airlines Staff are rude, unhelpful and untrained at dealing with customers. They don't want to accommodate people with babies. Staff lie to customers. Not once but on several occasions. I needed to confirm 3 times that we would need a bassinet, and were told we would get one (three times). On arrival to the airport they said we didn't get one anyway. Bassinets were available on flight but LA801 (a 13 hour flight) but no one with babies got them. Normal economy people were sitting in those seats. I have never seen babies sitting on parents laps when bassinets were available. It states on their website that we have a right to get a bassinet and it is the safest place for babies. I would like to add that we were talking to other parents with young a babies and none of us got bassinets. One parents weren't even sitting together, one other was travelling by herself and they woul't even make the seat next to her free. They all had the same issues as it.

LAN Airlines Boeing 787 with a nice roomy feeling, big windows. LAN does not use the mood-light functions like Avianca for example. Not sure why. They just dim the light. 3x3x3 seating is not great if you are a single traveler or a couple. Then the old 767 is better. Flights were on time, cabin very clean, but restrooms dirty during the flight.  Seat pitch is ok, but there are no foot rests like Avianca. After I couple of hours I really missed them as my legs and feet began to hurt. Flight attendants friendly and smiling. Food is tasty but portions are small so eat something before you take off. Good complementary wine and several refills were offered. Attendants come through the aisles with water during the night. Very good entertainment system. Lots of movies and tons of songs on big personal screens. Minus is that there is no remote control so you always have to move up to the touch screen to zap around. Just bring your own headset. LAN gives you 2 contact headsets but IFE has only one plug-in so you'll get only mono sound using the LAN sets. Blankets and pillows provided. On the outbound even eye covers and ear plugs. Not on the way back though. No hot towels as I'm used to from European or Asian Carriers. Would be a nice perk. Overall a good experience and I will fly LAN again.",3,4,0,Boeing 787,LATAM Airlines

However, the flight was delayed due to unknown reasons, no reason was every given. The staff at the check-in were, I cannot find words in the English language to do their, utter, extraordinary, total incompetence justice. There were only two on the desks with queues stretching out for some distance. Yet there were many staff members chatting to each other, or on radios or mobile phones and when they felt like it interrupting the members on the desk and the people on the desk talking on their mobile phones, disappearing to a back office, at one point there was know body sitting at the desks, I could go on. I could hear people in the other queue shouting that they would miss their flights. When I finally got to the front desk I was informed that “don’t worry the flight is delayed 20 minutes you will not miss your flight” meaning the Cusco flight to Lima. I finally got the flight to Lima, only to be informed by the pilot mid air that the flight was an hour delayed. I arrived at Lima only to be informed that my connecting flight had long gone. I entered a very long queue called “missed departures” the one and only member of staff on the desk made the staff at Cusco look like members of MENSA and NASA!! That one person it appeared could not stick to one task, she continually let other members of staff interrupt her, disappeared, you get the picture etc etc entertained a small group of people who forming an unofficial queue, it was a total mess, I stood with other for over two hours, with no refreshments, no information, nothing. When it was my turn the lady said I could wait for another 24 hours and get the 20:05 KLM or she could put me on an Air Europa flight to Madrid then Amsterdam then Manchester. I said no I wanted to go to either Amsterdam, Manchester or Madrid, Amsterdam as that is what I had paid for. This sent her into confusion, with much tapping of the keyboard and phone calls both land line and mobile. Then she said “yes the flight goes to Madrid and then Manchester. I asked her to confirm this that it did not go to Amsterdam, no she said Madrid then Manchester, no Amsterdam. She then after many interruptions booked me a Hotel for 5 hours and a Taxi, she also gave me a code that I should show at the Air Europa check-in. I returned to Lima Airport went to the Air Europa check-in handed in my code. There was a few phone calls and then the lady tapped on a calculator and showed me a large number. I asked if that was the ticket number, no it the cost of a new ticket. The lady at the missed departure line the day before had only made a reservation and had not booked any flight tickets at all! So another trip to the other side of Lima airport to talk to another LAN Airlines member of staff. You guessed it many mobile calls, land line calls, tapping of keyboards etc etc. Then asked to wait for 5 minutes, I asked what was happening he could not tell me, and proceeded to deal other people. Then, after some time, he calls me back and tells me that the tickets are booked, Lima to Madrid, then Amsterdam and then Manchester. I could have screamed, but I just wanted to get out of there and so took the tickets. Little did I know that Air Europa is a very poor substitute for KLM.

LAN's facilities at JFK are way below standard and they can't handle the slightest problem. While there were weather issues on both ends of our trip they did not justify the poor handling of flights by LAN. On the outgoing flight there were 3 planes loads of passengers waiting at one gate at JFK. This is close to 1000 people all expecting to fly out. It appears LAN only has one gate at JFK. Also they seem to be dependent on American Airlines to service their planes. When something goes wrong like the weather American will of course service their own planes first. The counter staff continually lied to everyone about the situation. The only truthful statement they made was that the flights were not cancelled. When our plane finally was ready to board 7 hours late all 1000 people were trying to figure out what flight was boarding because the lighted sign was wrong and still said all flights were on time. Finally someone taped a paper sign over the lighted sign to say what flight was boarding. Our flight was first of 3 and we were 7 hours late. I have no idea how long the other folks waited. On the return flight the Captain proudly announced we landed at JFK on time. However we sat in the plane for 2.5 hours on the tarmac because there were no gates. Finally to avoid being fined (after 3 hours) they unloaded us on the tarmac and bussed us to the terminal. Why didn't they do that 2 hours earlier? I will never fly LAN in the US again. They don't have the facilities and depend on American which itself is another story. Our experience in South America has been much better.

We were scheduled to depart at 8pm from Terminal 8 (American/One World but Air Berlin plane still at our gate). It had snowed earlier that day so flights were being cancelled or delayed however the LAN flight was still being shown on the departure information board as being on time. The young lady from LAN also told me that the flight was on time. We finally took off at 11pm after being de-iced. In the air LAN was very good in the past I used American to MVD from New York (via Miami) and the difference between the two airlines in the air was like night and day. The FA's were friendly young and interacted with the passengers. Missed connection in SCL but LAN had rebooked me on later flight to MVD and also gave me a voucher for food as my flight was not until mid afternoon. Flight to MVD on A320 the seats seemed to be wider than on the 787 and also a bit more leg room. Coming back from MVD to JFK everything was OK until departure from SCL. We were scheduled to depart at 11pm but due to full load plus many families with kids we did not take off until midnight. Again service and food in the air was excellent (2 entree choices at dinner and breakfast). We were scheduled to arrive at 8am into JFK as we began our descent the pilot announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather and we were being diverted to EWR. We landed at 9.30am waited for an hour to get a gate in Terminal B went through Immigration and then waited an hour and a half for luggage. Only staff from LAN were the FA's on our flight and they knew as much as we did. I finally left the airport at 1.30pm. LAN was great in the air but not so good on the ground.,5,5,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines
258110,2015-03-04,Chris Beck,False,Not specified,Economy Class,Not specified,Not specified,4,5,0,4,yes,LAN Airlines customer review,I flew LAN on Feb 14 from JFK to MVD via SCL. Flight was scheduled to depart at 8pm. However it snowed (not heavily) that afternoon. Arrived at JFK with plenty of time. Flight shown on departure board as being on time. I was at the gate at 7pm and the flight still showed on time however there was an Air Berlin plane at our gate. According to the agent the flight was still leaving on time even though the plane was not there. We finally left the gate at about 10pm and had to wait to be de-iced. Took off at 11pm. Plane was a Dreamliner and other than the having little room between seats was great. Food service on LAN was much better than on American which I usually use to go to MVD. Flight attendants were young enthusiastic and had good rapport with the passengers. Dinner was a choice of beef or pasta and I chose the beef which was quite good. LAN still uses regular cutlery for meal service (no plastic ware) and glass for wine (no plastic cup). Breakfast was also a choice of two different meals cheese sandwich or eggs and sausage which I chose. The eggs and sausage came in s ceramic dish. Far cry from American's minuscule continental breakfast. Arriving at SCL all transit passengers went to transit area LAN had already printed boarding passes for connecting flights and also provided voucher for food while waiting for the connection. I don't think that any US carrier would do that nowadays. Flight from SCL to MVD was on A320 which was more comfortable than seating on Dreamliner. LAN offered snack service (sandwich and beverage) on 2.5 hour flight which most US carriers do not do any more. Return from MVD to SCL was also on A320 boarding pass issued at MVD showed Gate 5 however departure board showed Gate 4 (which was correct gate). Again LAN offered snack service to SCL. SCL to NYC was a nightmare. We were scheduled to leave at 11pm but did not depart until midnight. The plane was full with families with children onboard many of whom cried screamed at night. Perhaps airlines should keep a stock of pacifiers on board. After take off dinner was served and again the offerings were much better than American's. We were scheduled to land at 8am at JFK as we began our approach and landing gear and flaps were down the captain announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather conditions and we would go to Newark instead. Landed at Newark at 9.30am and waited for an hour on taxiway for gate to be made available. Disembarked at 10.30 and by 11 was through passport control. Then we had to wait for 90 minutes for the luggage to start coming onto the carousel. Left the airport at 1pm. LAN had no one there for assistance except some of the flight attendants who did no have that much information. LAN was great in the air but terrible on the ground.,4,5,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines
258108,2015-03-04,L Smith,False,Not specified,Economy Class,Not specified,Not specified,1,1,0,3,no,LAN Airlines customer review,The customer service on LAN varied greatly. At the check in desk staff went out of their way to be helpful. Flight attendants on the flights from BA to Lima to JFK were awful. I asked for a glass of water it never arrived. Later I asked if we could get a bottle of water I was told no. When I asked for ice during the drink service only 1 or 2 cubes were provided. A flight to JFK will include a certain number of Americans who don't prefer warm drinks. The cabin in row 14 was extremely warm i.e. uncomfortable. When using the restrooms I noticed the rear of the plane was quite comfortable. I went to ask flight attendants if something could be done of if they could look into the temperature. They acted like it was a crazy request. A few hours later after my hands and feet were uncomfortably swollen a flight attendant stopped by to see if anyone had answered the call button. This I'd pressed about an hour before. This is lousy service. This flight attendant was marvellous. This new attendant however said that the pilot controls the cabin temperature and in fact it was quite warm in our area. She said she'd discuss the issue with the pilot. Half an hour later the temperature was beginning to come down and there was some airflow in the cabin. While we appreciated this one flight attendant and the check in desk service greatly the rest of our experience with LAN staff was miserable. Maybe re-training is in order.,1,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

258114,2015-02-12,Ricardo Palma,False,Not specified,Premium Economy,Not specified,Not specified,3,1,0,2,no,LAN Airlines customer review,Service on this airline is of the poorest quality not up to international standards. My family and I were flying from Peru to the US. We purchased American Airlines tickets but the flight was operated by LAN - apparently LAN and American have a going partnership. I am a frequent AA flyer and thus enjoy their Advantage priority check in. When checking through LAN's priority queue which BTW was empty I was informed that they could only check me in but not my wife and daughters - LAN wanted to split the family. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I only received very rude treatment. This has never happened to me before while flying with other major airlines. So I guess the moral of this story is if you're an AA frequent flyer and expect to be treated as such avoid LAN at all costs.,3,3,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Nowadays there is not much differences between the main airlines and LAN offered what is expected in Economy Class: Two full meals (somewhat more basic than on main European carriers but portions a little larger) good IFE system and professional service from the staff - less personal but on European carriers but nothing to complain about. Main complain was the hard narrow seats on Boeing 777-300ER as in other carriers using the 3x4x4 option seats are much less comfortable than formerly and make long-distant flights something of a challenge but TAM is not alone here.,4,4,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Good flight and impressed with the amount of legroom in economy and reasonable film choices - neither myself nor my husband can sleep on planes - so that is important. Unfortunately when we returned from Santiago to Madrid we were on an Iberia flight. Again good legroom but horror of horrors no individual screens! The flight was interminable - 3 very poor films were shown back to back and so for more than six hours there was not even any flight information available. Would not want to travel with this airline again because of the links with this airline - which is a shame as the seats were far more comfortable than BA. Didn't feel that the cabin staff were particularly attentive - soft drinks had to be requested rather than being offered through the night on the return journey.,3,1,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

I have flown this route over 20 times in the past 10 years. Fast efficient check in able to relax in Qantas Lounge in Sydney before flight. Slept most of the way to NZ. However flight crew were cheerful and helpful. Auckland to Santiago was an extremely pleasant flight. Meal quality and choices were excellent could have gone back for seconds thirds of the smoked salmon with mango salsa for entree. This was followed by a lovely lamb rack with sweet potato mash all washed down with a fine selection of Chilean wines. Seat coverts into a lie flat bed offering a comfortable sleep of which I got 7 hours. Cannot comment on the IFE as I did not use. Flight arrived 40 minutes early.

LAN provided a good on-time service complete with some basic but tasty meals and wine. Emerald status which meant straightforward access to their business lounges in both Santiago and Montevideo and use of wifi etc. My only complaint was that as I'm not much good with Spanish it was occasionally difficult to follow what the flight attendants were asking. As they are part of Oneworld they will be getting more and more non-local speakers on board so they should focus on language skills even on regional and local routes. Otherwise quite a good experience.,4,2,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines
258123,2014-12-18,C Abelson,False,Not specified,Economy Class,Not specified,Not specified,1,4,0,3,no,LAN Airlines customer review,In November we embarked on a 3 week trip to Chile and Easter Island. I was quite excited that the most significant legs of our trips (NY-Santiago and return) would be flown on the Boeing 787. It turned out to be about the most uncomfortable that I have ever had on an airline. The seat configuration was 3-3-3 and the seats were very narrow and cramped. I am not a large person and it was impossible to sleep due to the closeness of the seats. The food on the flight down was basically inedible a pasty gummy pasta with a flavorless sauce. On the return flight as breakfast was served a couple hours before arriving in NY they had run out of breakfast omelettes by the time that they had reached our seats (and we were only in the middle of the main cabin.) We passed on the ham and cheese sandwich which was the only thing available. Domestic flights from Santiago to Punta Arenas Calama and Easter Island were no better. All very cramped and on the return flight from Easter Island two of the four lavatories in coach were not functioning and could not be used. The only redeeming aspect of the flights is that they provide free headsets on every flight. I know that when flying to South America there are not a lot of choices but I will attempt to avoid LAN if at all possible on my next visit there. It is a terrible airline to fly in coach.,2,5,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

I was so pleasantly surprised by the level of service and friendliness of the cabin crew. I had read prior to our trip mixed reviews so was somewhat apprehensive when it came time to travel. Past reviews couldn't have been more far of the mark! The cabin crew were really friendly. My partner is a very nervous flyer and on every leg we flew with them the cabin crew kept checking in on him to make sure he was okay. On our way home flying into Auckland we were told there was bad weather and one lovely cabin crew member even offered to sit by him as we landed. The food was nice and not too heavy and on the long haul sectors cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisle with drinks. The inflight entertainment system was fantastic and I would put it on par with Emirates ICE system! Any negatives? The only thing I could say is that the seats were a little uncomfortable but then being over 6 ft I get the same problem with other airlines. On the whole a most enjoyable experience.,4,5,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

At the hotel received at least five different notices on departure time that ranged from early morning on Sunday to late evening in random order. After more than five hours given boarding passes to Santiago despite the fact that tickets were to La Paz and told them that that was all they could do and that someone in Santiago was taking care of the following flights - a lie. At Santiago regrettably things were not any better. Given boarding passes to Lima still not La Paz on a plane departing from Santiago at 10pm which meant another eight hours wait however it would not have been the main problem which was arriving into Lima too late to catch the flight to La Paz and needing to wait at the airport for the next flight in the morning - this was not explained and no guidanc on sleeping or hotels. Eventually they managed to find space on the earlier flight at 8.00pm which made possible for them to connect to La Paz the same day landed on Monday at 5.30 am - suitcases of course didn't. In the last six trips a member of my family flew LAN four times and the flight was either cancelled or delayed.

Overall very pleasant flights particularly due to the friendly efficiency of the crews. Good food and drink and efficient service. On the transpacific routes the A340 has two business class cabins. The rear one (rows 6 and 7) is very cold and apparently the temperature cannot be adjusted so avoid these rows if you can. They are obviously aware of this problem because on both journeys the crew moved all passengers (including us) out of rows 6 and 7 into the forward cabin (rows 1 to 5) where we were much more comfortable. However we were in rows 6 and 7 for the short legs from Sydney to Auckland and vice versa where we had to use blankets over our shoulders to keep warm. We greatly enjoyed our flight in the LAN Dreamliner from Buenos Aires to Santiago. It's a much more comfortable plane than the A340. The lounge in Santiago is quite basic. It's narrow and in a basement but offers some chance to relax. The lounges in Buenos Aires and Auckland (Qantas lounge) are far superior.,4,4,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

I had a degree of trepidation in relation to flying LAN after reading some negative reviews. Flight across was fine. Comments in relation to food seating decor and cabin crew appeared consistent with what I have read. However having flown with LAN on 12 internal flights whilst in South America my respect for LAN's efficiency great timekeeping friendliness of both ground and cabin staff excellent facilities has increased.

Throughout all flights I was greatly impressed by the efficiency of LAN. Ground and cabin crews were friendly and helpful. The LAN boxed meals on (one class) short flights was consistent. Cabin crew warm and welcoming. Trolley service by cabin crew was excellent despite the fact that the majority of flights were fully booked. The one sour point was that the inflight entertainment (IPL-SCL) failed in my section of the aircraft. However having had a tsunami alert whilst on Easter Island in the early hours of my departure day I relished the chance for a sleep. This flight is treated as an international flight.

When I had 3 connecting flights from Chile to New York the first 2 flights I was provided with a vegetarian meal however the third and also the longest flight for some reason I was not provided with a vegetarian meal. On my last flight from Chile to Australia my flight was changed by LAN a month prior to the date. Whilst on the phone with a LAN representative I requested a vegetarian meal again to make sure after the last flight I would not have a reoccurring problem. It was assured to me that the meal was requested. The day of the flight I rang LAN to make sure that I had a vegetarian meal unfortunately however in the system it appeared that I had not requested it. The frustrating thing was I requested the meal over a month ago when they called to change my flight.

Our first inklings that something was wrong was when the flight did not start boarding on time. They only announced about half an hour after the flight was meant to take off that there was something wrong with the plane which meant that the flight was delayed for about 3 hours. The communication from the ground staff was almost non-existent. They merely told us our flight was delayed and made little to no effort to keep us updated or get those of us on ongoing international flights on re- routed flights. The counter staff albeit very stressed understandably were not very helpful. We were given some coupons for food but it honestly took around 2 hours standing in the queue even to get a coupon for a coffee because the counters had one or two staff for a line of around 200 passengers. I had to beg at the counter to try to get a re-routed flight through Hong Kong - a suggestion I had to make! After finally getting re-routed LAN refused to release my baggage to my new carrier (Cathay Pacific) even though the aircraft had been sitting on the tarmac for about 7 hours by the time my new flight departed - a fact that seemed completely unacceptable to Cathay Pacific who tried very hard to get our bags on the new flight and said they had repeatedly asked LAN to release the bags to them. I eventually arrived in South Africa a full 14 hours later than I should have but thankful to be there at all. In talking to some of the other carrier staff on the ground in Auckland before I left (and after I returned) this was not a once-off occurrence and LAN is regularly delayed in Auckland.,0,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines
258144,2014-06-13,Lam Kok Wai,False,Not specified,Economy Class,Not specified,Not specified,5,5,0,5,yes,LAN Airlines customer review,We took LAN from Sao Paulo to Lima from Lima to Cuzco (return) as well as from Lima to Iguazu Brazil. All four segments were good and on time. Food and drinks served were ok. Staff were friendly and cheerful. Typical south American hospitality. If you are flying LAN as a foreigner once you buy more than 3 segments online you are automatically put on LANPASS and enjoy substantial savings compared to flying just one route or two. Only buy tickets using the South American pass if you want the change of date/time flexibility as the cost will be substantially higher for such flexibility. I bought the tickets through the USA website and they allowed me to cancel FOC within 24 hours I lost only the currency conversion as well as processing fee. Planes are normally quite full. Ask for window seats if you want to see Lake Titicaca on daylight flights.,4,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines
258145,2014-06-13,Anthony Gibbons,False,Not specified,Economy Class,Not specified,Not specified,2,4,0,2,no,LAN Airlines customer review,Flew LAN on a QANTAS /TAM ticket from Auckland to Rio return connecting through Santiago (16 May return last Sunday 8 June). LAN seem to have major operational issues with their A343 flights to and from Oceania. Being kind one could say they are erring on the side of caution but significant punctuality issues where flights are frequently either delayed or cancelled does not inspire confidence (retrospectively checked flightaware.com to verify my suspicions). LAN800 delayed ex Auckland by over 1 hour which proved QFs text message received the night before to be correct. Contacted QF on receipt regarding my 1h20 min connection as was travelling on to Europe from Rio same day. Told to contact LAN directly. Did so and LAN adamant that no problem with connecting as flight on time. Phooey! Encountered same circus at Santiago on arrival from Rio enroute home. Went to allocated gate to snare some snooze time for the 4 hours transit only to wake up to 2 gate changes (from gate 11 to 14 then finally 17B) one flight status of 'cancellado' and one of 'atrasado' (delayed). All for the same LAN801. Amazing. Flight eventually left some hours after scheduled 2320h take off as a replacement crew then needed to be called up. Insult to injury was the dinner served around 4-5am. Food masquerading as beef is not worth being kept awake for. Real shame as inflight the crew are pretty charming and attentive. I would expect these shenanigans from AR with whom I've previously travelled to Argentina. Had hoped LAN would be superior. On the positive side the flights between Santiago and Rio were pleasant. Just wish there was a reliable alternative or LAN just got its act together.,1,4,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Some of the most friendly flight attendants I have come across. I think they were Bogota-based at this flight was operated by LAN Colombia. The flight departed at midnight and arrived in Santiago at 6.30am next day so food option was a quiche for dinner and a muffin for breakfast. I personally expected something better and I did not eat anything in LAN's beautiful lounge at Bogota's airport before boarding. Most people went straight to bed after taking off. One would have to be extremely tired and sleepy to be able to sleep. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. They are very hard and narrow and there is not space to store anything apart from in the literature pocket in front. Do not leave stuff on your side as they will be swallowed by the seat when it is put in the bed position. The wonderful crew took ages to retrieve my glasses that simply disappeared.,2,4,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

I was on LA801 SCL-AKl on 5 June which first was delayed and then cancelled. At all times we were kept informed and once they announced the cancellation we were taken to one of various very good hotels for the night. The next day a LAN representative came to the hotel around lunchtime to update us and announced that the flight would finally be leaving 23 hours after the original planned departure time. We were well looked after up to boarding time. I also found that the cabin crew spoke much better English than in the past and were very attentive. I was in economy but as on other trips I found their meals to be excellent. All in all a much improved airline.,5,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

LAN called the evening before to inform me of three hour delay which I explained was problematic due to a two hour connection in SYD. Reservation staff assured me they would put me on another flight back to LAX in the morning at airport when I checked in. That was a complete ill truth as check- in was handled by Air NZ whom did nothing and quite rude. Was then booked on Qantas which was fantastic whom made sure I made my connection.

258151,2014-05-23,N Francis,False,Not specified,Economy Class,Not specified,Not specified,4,4,0,4,yes,LAN Airlines customer review,BOG-CTG Quick hop between Bogota and Cartagena one way for about £60. There's always a slight issue when flying internally from the capital's airport as neither airline or airport websites taxi drivers nor some employees seem to have consensus on which terminal anyone flies from. The issue with this is that the old terminal has no physical connection to the new so transit between is a bit of a bother. Thankfully all LAN flights currently go from the new El Dorado terminal which is clean and modern. Even though it wasn't that busy it still seemed to take around 45 minutes to get to a check in desk - large numbers of employees chatting rather than working seemed to be the problem. Once checked in quickly through to domestic departures which has a few bars and shops. Warm welcome onboard a brand new A320. Very comfy seats with decent legroom. Minor altercation as we approached the runway as a gentleman behind me had brought a chicken onboard with him unnoticed by the crew - or indeed by any security personnel on the ground. Incredulously the captain elected to take off anyway. Smooth flight with complimentary tea coffee and juice as well as a small snack box of chips and cookies - nicely presented and perfectly adequate for the 60min flight. Landed on time and bags off swiftly. Good flight only slightly marred by inefficient ground staff and live animal policy!,4,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Free entertainment in back of seat. Two meals and snack on short Lima to Cusco flight. US airlines too stingy to go old school. Uber friendly flight attendants. Only weird thing is 10lb limit on carry on. When checking in bag I also had a normal rolling carry on and a small purse. The rolling back weighed 12 lbs and my purse 3.5? They made me rearrange my carry ons so the rolling bag was not over 10lbs. You know once I walked into airport I changed it right back. Flight from Lima to Peru didn't even ask to weigh and it was much smaller plane. They also do not accept TSA pre check at Bradley terminal LAX very disappointing.,4,5,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

After a very long time at the LAN desk in Santiago I was put on a flight to Buenos Aires to connect to Sao Paulo. Unfortunately the girl at the LAN Santiago desk did not book me on the flight she told me I was booked onto. The flight was full and I found out about this when I got to Buenos Aires. They managed to find me a seat on a packed dirty TAM plane in Economy class. My ticket was for Business class. My flight originated in Melbourne I'm an old Qantas frequent flyer customer and I was extremely disappointed with the service. To top it all up my 2 suitcases did not arrive. The LAN on-board service and flight attendants were extremely good but the ground staff were very poorly equipped to deal with arriving passengers.

Only coffee or water on internal flights offered and no sense of urgency considering flight time. Other airlines manage to serve food and full bar service on such a flight sector. Transfer in Medellin not recognised had to exit and go through the tedious security before sent back to check in since no hand luggage tag given since previous check in at Bogota! No lounge facilities at both airports even though to Quito it was international. Process in Medellin unacceptable. Service inflight to Quito with limited drinks and no alcohol food or even snack offered. When asked to have a beer was told they would check in the back but the crew never returned. No food at all during the 90 minute flight and in the end no drink! The crew were more interested passing through the cabin announcing duty free sales and shopping. Ghost pilots with no announcements and could hardly understand the English from the crew! In my humble opinion a terrible airline lacking service and consistency. This taking into consideration the relatively expensive ticket for such a short journey with lack of service despite being a Oneworld Emerald member.,1,2,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Would have preferred completely lie-flat beds though like we had Madrid- Santiago in 2011. Food excellent well-chosen wines and very cheerful and attentive cabin staff. We also used LAN for 3 internal flights in economy and had no complaints there either. The flight from El Calafate to Buenos Aires was two hours late but our agent was informed and departure from our hotel delayed so we weren't hanging around at the airport. Special mention for Lima Business Class lounge - a smoker's paradise! Open to the air so no tobacco smell and comfortably furnished.

Beautiful flight over the Andes mountains - the pilot came on to point out a few mountain tops in Spanish and English. Not even a drink service - I've been on other 40 min flights that at least had water offered. But good flight overall. 767-300 from SCL to MIA - excellent! Purser came to my seat and thanked me personally for being Emerald One World - very nice.

We didn't even board until 6.15pm through buses - agent had said we would board through a jet bridge but anyone who has flown LA from AEP knows Aerolineas Argentinas uses the jet bridges and makes LA use stairs on the Tarmac to board. Bussed to aircraft - friendly attendant greeted passengers at both front and rear doors. Pilot apologized for the delay. Quick take off and 1 hour 40 minutes to Mendoza. Snack box was appreciated but mostly sugary cookies - not healthy at all. Flight landed and bags off quick. LAN is a good airline but sometimes leaves little things to be desired.

At 4.00pm it was announced that the flight was delayed until 7.00am the next day. Passengers passports were collected to get the exit stamp revoked when passports were handed back 2 hours later it was done in a nerve wrecking fashion. I asked one of the staff if there was another flight that night to Southern California he said no. Later I see someone getting onto standby and I learn there was another flight that night. I waited on standby and did not get a spot. I took the appointed taxi to the hotel I was given to stay at. At the airport I get my new boarding pass. I get to the boarding gate and learned that the flight is delayed again. Throughout the whole process staff would make important announcements only in Spanish. I would ask for a translation and some of the staff were unable to give it. Hours later the flight finally got off the ground.

Rest of the crew very polite helpful speaking several languages. A very pleasant experience for a flight in economy very recommendable. Good food (even breakfast which can be a big problem with other airlines) good drinks excellent IFE in a new 787. Seats ok I am 1.75m and not very broad. It seems the seats are narrower than on other planes I managed to get some sleep anyway.

The purser introducing herself was a nice personal touch. 787 Dreamliner is a great silent plane and I like the coloring of the windows instead of blinds.

Clean planes good crews and largely on time. It's their systems that are a big problem starting with the fact you can't reserve seats in advance until check-in is available 48 hours prior to departure. I find that problematic and then tried unsuccessfully to get seats and check in online 48 hours prior to the flight only to get a message saying I had multiple destinations and needed to call them. Not acceptable nowadays. One of my flights had a time change of an hour and I was never notified and only found out when I got to the airport. Finally one of my segments was from Iquitos connecting in Lima and then on to Cuzco. My bag was the only one on the flight to Cuzco that did not arrive. OK that happens but they handled it horribly. They really need to get their systems and customer service up to current standards particularly as you pay a premium on LAN over the other domestic Peruvian carriers.,3,4,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

However LAN is terrible when it comes to customer service if anything goes wrong. We were at our gate two hours early and followed the signage since we didn't speak the local language. The signage was all wrong and our flight left without us. We were literally standing under a video screen with our flight information that said pre-boarding and that the fight was delayed and it turns out the flight left from a different line somewhere. Ok so is there another flight we can get to the destination from anyone at this airport? No they said. Only a flight at the same time the next day which would have defeated the purpose of our trip. We investigated ourselves and found out they just pulled that out of nowhere because there were several other flights from other airlines that day. So we booked one of those flights and made arrangements with LAN to pick up our luggage when we got there since it was on the missed flight. They said they had called and arranged for our luggage to be taken to the luggage office and to pick it up when we got there. When we got there LAN had gone home for the day and locked our bags away. No bag for us until the next day. Never again will I fly LAN airlines. Absolutely unacceptable customer service.,3,3,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

I travelled with an 88 yr old relative who went Business Class and I went Economy. Only one of our 6 flights was delayed and only by 35 mins. This caused a missed connecting flight which was sorted out seamlessly baggage transferred all good. LAN made sure I could be close to my relative by putting me at the very front of Economy each time. I was also allowed to use their lounges as I was flying with someone in Business Class. The only lounge which wouldn't let me in was a Qantas one in Sydney at the start of the journey even though my relative had a guest pass for me and I'm a Qantas FF. They apparently share the same One World system as LAN. Cabin crew were great seats were good food fine selection of films huge - cost way less than Qantas halfway between the Qantas price and the Aerolineas Argentinas price.

Asked to see supervisor and was told supervisor was in meeting and would be available only after flight departure time.

Although this was only a 2.5 hour flight in a 767 we had the new LAN full-size flat-bed seats. Tremendous views crossing the Andes with no turbulence. The disappointment was the dinner. Just a cold chicken sandwich and desert with no choice. Although I understand their desire to avoid service during the potentially turbulent Andes crossing I thought LAN could do a bit better than this for international business class.

I flew back with LAN from a recent trip to South America having flown out with Iberia. I was pretty impressed really. We were on a new 787. The entertainment system was good with a touch screen and lots of films. Only issue was that my system crashed twice but staff were happy to reset this and then it worked fine again. The food on board was also pretty good for airline food I had a nice salmon dish with mashed potato (luckily this is what I would have ordered as they'd run out of everything else by the time they reached the back of the plane). Breakfast was an omelette amongst other things. They were very generous with the drinks too offering several top ups and also a whisky when they cam round with the coffee trolley after dinner. I thought the staff on board where really good as well attentive and always quick to respond if you called for them. All in all a good experience and better than my Iberia flight on the way out.,4,4,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

From Sydney to Santiago with a stop in AKL (and vice versa) I flew on a A340. This plane was defiantly one of the oldest planes in the LAN fleet however it was still comfortable onboard. The seats on the plane were old and overused and the back support wasn't good however I did find I had the best sleep ever (and I have flown a lot). The cabin crew onboard this flight were polite and considerate but their English wasn't up to scratch. The IFE system had all the latest entertainment however the system it self was outdated (screen resolution bad and buttons missing on controller). The food onboard the flight was fantastic. I have read previous reviews about this airline and I don't understand why they are complaining. To improve LAN needs to be operating their 787 along this route as it would benefit passengers considering that it is the longest route LAN operates. Domestic: Positives: Staff were polite got 'upgraded' plane was clean. Negatives: Dry food only. No hot or substantial meals just a box of biscuits and a drink.,5,3,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

The staff were unfriendly and inattentive didn't seem to have a clue of what to do at times and spoke very little and very bad English (for passengers who didn't speak Spanish). The aircraft although clean and neat was quite uncomfortable both the aisles and the seats were too narrow which made it difficult to walk to the bathroom without hitting anyone and impossible to go anywhere if there was already someone standing up. Trying to get any sleep was also hell as there was almost no legroom and if you were unlucky like me to get a seat next to a fat guy there was even less room to move around and seat comfortably.

Problems were with ground staff and integrity of information. The staff that served us in the air were good. Flights booked by NZ travel agent including connecting flights on Air NZ from Auckland to Wgtn. Turned up on time and were asked if we wanted to volunteer to stay another night as flight overbooked. It later became apparent that this was a requirement not an option. Later learnt that a huge number of people were bumped from the flight and that some had been bumped several days in a row. Received inconsistent stories from different staff about various aspects of package to stay. Staff spoke English until asked difficult questions then claimed to not speak English. Staff were rude and at some points simply walked away while being spoken to. When using our Chilean host to translate two different stories were told within the space of ten minutes each limiting our rights more. When a passenger produced proof of an earlier conversation he was yelled at. When we got to hotel various details of our package were not passed on. Half the group had no transfer to airport the next night and had to fight for an hour to get compensated for the taxi. Domestic transfers were missed and LAN rebooked NZ airlines for some. However when the documents LAN produced were reproduced at Auckland bookings were bogus and no record of booking existed. Passengers had to sort out bookings themselves. My seat was adequate although head rest was broken. Staff were nice on the plane but cold eggs for breakfast and no meal for vegetarians. Movie selection very small. Would avoid at all costs. Heard from frequent travelers that flights within South America are usually fine but long haul often problematic. Unfortunately our LAN experience was of being dismissed and fobbed of with lies and false promises when queried the walls just go up.,2,1,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

This time round I flew with LAN both long haul Madrid/Lima return and also domestic flights within Peru. Seat size is OK but if the person in front reclined their seat back you just had no space at all in front. Toilets were constantly kept clean. Food was worst food I have had on any economy long haul flight. No choice of vegetarian. Although I'm not vegetarian I tend to eat vegetarian food on the planes. If you are vegetarian you have to request vegetarian food when booking the flight ticket. Other economy airlines haven't required this as they always include a veggie option in the menu but not LAN. I had to have a meat dish and when I bit into it the food was stone cold in the middle and lukewarm on the outside. Clearly the food had not been warmed up properly. Inedible! On my return flight I risked the food and paid the price for doing so. Staff during my flight out seemed pleasant enough but on my return journey they were unfriendly and sullen. Entertainment system restrictive. Worst and smallest choice of films I've encountered in economy long haul. However all short domestic flights within Peru were actually very good. No delays the snack offered wasn't bad and all staff served you with a smile! So recommend for domestic flights but don't recommend for long haul.,1,1,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive very impressed. Drinks service was good however the Louis Roederer was in short supply and ran out within the first hour. Dinner was delicious but breakfast was a little disappointing with the fruit yoghurt being replaced with natural yoghurt and no sign of the requested pastry.

No notice was taken of the instructions to turn off electronic devices - one guy was sending and receiving texts in plain view the crew didn't seem to notice even when they were walking up and down checking that seatbelts were fastened!

You can also use these points (OneWorld) on American Airlines and as such our flights were SAO-LIMA-NYC rather than AA's SAO-NYC direct. LAN recently purchased Brazil's TAM and they are yet to fully integrate their systems. This caused us a huge problem as we landed in Peru with 'tickets' from LAN (but no boarding passes) for a TAM flight to Sao Paulo. Had to wait 4 hours (with a 2 year old) before any TAM staff showed up. When TAM finally arrived they didn't have our booking and the flight was fully booked! 8 hours after landing and numerous discussions later LAN finally agreed to put us on the next available flight (4pm - Taca) rather than wait another 16 hours for the next LAN/TAM flight. A few more discussions had them give us a hotel room for the additional 8 hour wait as 'complimentary club lounge access' doesn't mean much to a 2 year old child! The whole exercise simply rammed home my previous experiences with LAN - the in-flight crew comfort and service is excellent but the support staff at airports and offices are inefficient rude and arrogant. Flying with LAN is fantastic as long as nothing ever goes wrong and you have no need to rely on crew other than those serving you in the air.,5,5,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Nice flat beds (on a 3 hour flight was a bonus but this flight begins/ends in Santiago/Sydney) and good service nice food and extensive entertainment. All this was helped by the fact that business class was by no means full. In fact on the way out I was the only person in the smaller business cabin.

On return I went to JFK 7 hours before flight in an attempt to get emergency row seat. Told I had to wait until 4 hours before flight. LAN rep arrived told I had to make that request upstairs hours ago. There is really no interaction between crew and passengers save giving out meals and forcing you to put your seat in upright position half an hour before landing. I was told to 'sit down' when I had to go to the bathroom 40 minutes before landing in Buenos Aires. This was not a full flight.

Departure delayed slightly due to ATC but kept updated. Cabin announcements in Spanish and English. Dinner was quite good. Of note LAN used real silverware real glassware for the wine and a real dish for the entree even in economy. I had red wine which was Chilean and quite good. A refill was offered. After dinner coffee/tea and cordials were served along with M&Ms. IFE featured over 200 on demand movies including many South American films as well as games map function extensive music tracks and destination information. Screen was large and picture/sound quality was good. Content was slow to load at times but otherwise the system was excellent. The in-flight magazine was very thick and contained interesting articles. There was a cup holder on each seat back a nice feature on long flights. Lavatories featured moist towelettes and hand lotion a couple of extras not found on US carriers and were cleaned several times throughout the flight. A full breakfast was served 90 minutes prior to arrival which is better than the American carriers which only serve a snack.

I found the service to be consistent crew friendly aircraft clean and in good condition (767) and food tasty. The inflight entertainment worked and a good selection. The on board service did seem to take a bit of time to get going and the seat did seem a bit narrow around the shoulders when reclined into the flat bed. Other than that the flights were great. Check-in at all airports was easy lounges comfortable no lounge in Easter Island but I didn't expect that anyway as its such a unique airport and flights were on time.

When I arrived to check in at a connecting flight in Buenos Aires - I was told that the flight would be leaving 12 hours later. This is was despite the fact that I had already checked and they did not attempt to contact me by email or by mobile phone. When I arrived at Santiago we were given accommodation and were told to be ready by 8.30am for a 12 Noon departure. All passengers arrived at the Departure Gate - however there was no aircraft and much to our dismay no LAN Staff to explain what was happening. Eventually the flight departed 24 hours late and terminated at Auckland not Sydney - so continuing passengers were forced to stay overnight in a hotel at Auckland Airport - to make things worse the airport bus broke down and we eventually checked in at 2am. The service from LAN Airlines through this event was appalling - and not once did anyone apologise to myself or any of the other passengers.,2,3,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

We checked with our agent who confirmed the booking and each time we booked in we ask about the vegetarian meal but none arrived.

Arrived at the airport at Santiago at 4pm for a 10.30 flight and was told by LAN staff that we could not book in until 8pm. Made inquiries at 6.30 and was told the flight had been cancelled. They provided us with accommodation and meals at Santiago and Auckland but you had to go looking for the information it was never just offered to you. Flight was ordinary to Auckland. We were in the last row and every time the Flight Attendant pushed the trolley out of the galley she hit my wife's seat so sleep was off the cards. More offers of water during the flight would be a good start. We had one good flight and one bad one. Finally when we were given seat allocation we were not sitting together. As it turned out the last 3 centre rows had 4 couples in them and no one was seated together. How hard is it to allocate seating together when tickets are made on the same booking?

What I found was a pleasurable experience and a 9 hour flight that did not feel like 9 hours. We flew through the daytime so on-board entertainment was key. Boarding was easy and we flew a 767 in economy class. Seats were very comfortable the entertainment excellent the seats had USB ports for charging or electronic use and the food was good airline food. Wine was served with the meal and staff came around refilling glasses. Staff very happy and helpful smiling a lot and were excellent bilingual speakers. Not only were we served dinner (or lunch) but at the end of the flight at 8 pm Pacific time they served breakfast. The on-board entertainment included first-run movies TV shows games music.

Seats was fine for 3 hours don't think I would have like it long haul though. Staff were helpful and polite. Only major letdown was the food wouldn't normally comment as I tend to eat before I board but to be offered for breakfast a tiny ham and cheese sandwich 2 small crackers with a frozen tub of butter and a fruit bowl which consisted of 3 slices of apples and a lonely looking grape is really not acceptable.

Then Buenos Aires to Lima and Lima to JFK. All flights were on 767's. All flights were on time with clean aircraft extremely spacious and comfortable flat bed type seats excellent white duvets and pillows and an adequate VOD system. Catering was a bit skimpy and of decent quality. The main negative for this airline is the pleasant but almost consistently lazy and indifferent attitude of the cabin crews. The flights to Montevideo were with LAN Chilean crews and they were ok but beyond serving meals and a very long wait for drinks with no refills their presence in the cabin was seldom noted the MIA-SCL leg being 8 1/2 hours. The Peruvian crews on the BUE-LIM-JFK flights could generally be found congregated in the forward galley reading magazines and playing on their computers. They never almost never patrolled the cabin soliciting requests even on the 7 1/2 hour flight between Lima and JFK. However the great seat duvet and on time performance made up for me the poor slow cabin service and mediocre catering.,3,3,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Seats were hard and narrow. Food choice ran out before trolley reached us and the only food left was ghastly - wine serving was paltry. Inflight entertainment malfunctioned. One toilet was out of order before we even took off and the 4 functioning toilets were inadequate for a 13+ hour flight. Eye masks thin. Worst was the attitude of crew who were surly and unhelpful throughout and spent most of their time huddled in their galley.

Shouting ""sit down"" at a paying customer is unacceptable. What happened to the word 'please'? Meals were served during the first hour after take off after which crew disappeared for the entire flight. Individual mini bottles of wine with your meal have gone. Now you get just a 'mini glass' that holds a sip of wine. Morning service was abysmal - no hot drinks reheated scrambled eggs were disgusting and again - unhappy crew what showed you in all possible way that you were a nuisance in their otherwise bright day!

LAN expect you to be at the airport 3 hours before departure for international flights. They are not joking. Passengers like me who had already checked-in and printed their boarding cards were made to wait outside the cordoned off check-in area. We were admitted after airport security complained about the queue getting in the way of other passengers. After 50 minutes waiting it was my turn but the agent just held his hand up and got out his mobile phone. He was still chatting after I had finished leaving my bags with another agent. Boarded in strict priority of cabin class frequent flyer status and row numbers - then all got on to the same bus! Cabin crew too busy having coffee to check the boarding cards. Crew surly with no smiles or good-byes. Usual economy class type snack. Arrived on time with fairly quick bag return.

We worked out the seating ourselves and in the end I moved twice to enable family groups to sit together. If travelling on an internal flight ensure that you eat and take a drink with you beforehand. Offered either a lolly or a box which proudly proclaims 'the contents of this box contain no preservatives. Please consume within 48 hours.'

Plane was coming from Santiago. In the morning I received a phone call and sms announcing the delay of the plane (about 3 hours delay). Nice. Nevertheless once in the plane when getting to Frankfurt the pilot says we're running out of fuel and Frankfurt airport is very busy so instead we are to land in Dusseldorf to refuel. There we were. After refuelling he informs us there's a curfew for our plane to take off. So instead we will be spending the night in a hotel and that there would be buses waiting for us to take us to the hotel. It took us a while to get our luggage nearly 11 pm. No buses waiting. No company people to inform us (I understand LAN has no personnel there but what does oneworld serve for then?) Just got a train from Dusseldorf airport at 2:40 am and arrived in Frankfurt at 7am (on a personal choice and after paying it myself obviously).

Flights were on time lanes modern and well maintained seats comfortable onboard personnel friendly and helpful. The only problem was the NZ part of the trip. LAN was let down by its codeshare agreement with Qantas who book domestic flights on the budget airline Jetstar. Our Jetstar flight outbound was delayed and the return was cancelled. We were unable to check luggage through and had to carry our suitcases from domestic to international terminal and back. Jetstar refused to hear our complaint and Qantas refused. It became our problem and our extra cost to buy an Air new Zealand ticket to ensure we made our flight plan. Qantas does not honour the codeshare agreement with LAN and fails to provide adequate customer service. This is unfortunate because unlike Qantas LAN provides a high quality service at an acceptable cost.,4,4,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Very impressed with flights IFE and service offered. On one flight from Mendoza to Buenos Aires I experienced my first missed approach and must commend the pilots and crew for their professionalism during some anxious moments.

They only offered to put me on an alternative airline CTG-BOG which would give me 50 mins to disembark reclaim my luggage change terminals and then check in for the next flight - ridiculous. I ended up having to take a full refund and book with another airline.

Boarding procedure very good and the plane was in good order although we noticed the inflight magazines were very tatty. The seats were fairly comfortable IFE was pretty good with some blockbusters but when the person in front reclined it became very hard to use. I am going to rate the food as average the drinks were warm and although there were a number of water runs it wasn't cold enough. Cabin temperature was on the warm side throughout the flight. FA's gave a workman like performance although some very friendly. LAN is a good airline that can improve but has a little way to go before they are four star.,3,3,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

We were charged more than 5000 USD as penalty for extra-tickets in Economy class to Frankfurt. The tickets had hardly been issued when the time schedule was again changed and the connecting flight Madrid-Frankfurt was not guaranteed anymore. We had to spend a night at the airport and to board Iberia flights to get back to Europe. Again employees tried their best to find a solution and cared for my son who was sick.

Unfortunately when you travel with lap infants you really have no choice with seats as you are forced to sit in the middle rows as they are the ones that have the extra oxygen mask - you don't get the opportunity to upgrade to business class because you are travelling with a minor unless you are willing to pay the full price for everyone travelling with you.

The nightmare began when I arrived to GYE. Two more international flights arrived at the same time and it took more than an hour to collect my bags. Priority tags placed on my bags were no help. It took another hour to clear customs and when I left customs area I was informed I needed to go to the second floor of the terminal and drop my luggage to make my connection to Quito. When I arrived at LAN's counter I was informed my 7.30 am flight was closed and had to wait until 3 pm to go on the waiting list.

I only flew LAN Ecuador so cannot comment on other LAN branches. LAN has an excellent business class hard product especially for Latin America. The business class cabin is roomy and feels open the seats are very comfortable. The IFE is good plenty of movies and shows enough to keep me busy on a 6-7 hour flight. The food is very good I had fish both ways very nice meals. The problem I experienced both ways was with the service. The attendants are courteous however attentiveness drops significantly when you do not speak Spanish. On both trips it was very obvious Spanish speaking passengers received somewhat better service. All attendants seemed to speak English they were simply not keen on practising it. I would expect flight attendants on an international route to provide consistent service to all passengers. To sum it up despite this small annoyance LAN was an excellent value for the money I would recommend without hesitation. Lounge in GYE is ok but nothing to write home about.,4,4,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

International Economy cabin staff did the bare minimum regarding passenger assistance. To get a glass of water was an imposition and to be told to ""go down the back and get your own water"" was aggravating when you were confronted with at least 3 attendants sitting flicking thru magazines. Food and liquid was dished out in such an off- hand manner that twice myself and adjoining passenger were doused with water and soft drink. And the flights were not always full or demanding. The other gripe is a small or pleasant look on flight attendants faces would have been a welcome relief. So never again International LAN unless there is a distinct improvement with cabin staff.

They were far superior to Qantas. While selling as a LAN business class package there are actually no business seats for flying within Argentina or Chile so business is only for the International component. Flight attendants generally did their job very well and were friendly. The pisco sours from Lan were the nicest I had and food was always of good quality. The problem and this is a big one is with the scheduling. LAN schedules daily flights Santiago to Auckland but seem to cancel them quite easily. Our flight on the 21st March was cancelled and I believe a second flight was also cancelled that week. Obviously this causes major inconvenience and although we had plenty of notice we still had nothing else to do but spend time in the Santiago Airport holiday Inn. Some of the Argentine regional airports could have used a third check-in counter going (El Calafate Ushuaia) as there were long queues.

Traveling with two small children and speak very little Spanish from Santiago to Lima then Lima to Los Angeles the plane broke in Lima. I understand that planes break sometimes but the staff from LAN should communicate with passengers what is going on. After two hours of no information I noticed that everybody got up and either got in line or were leaving the gate. After asking several passengers I found out that the flight was not going to leave for 12 hours and we were supposed to go to the hotel. No one said what hotel or where it was located. In tears and clearly upset I followed other Spanish speaking passengers and 2 hours later was outside the airport getting on a bus that looked like it was going to break down without my luggage. No LAN staff members were around to tell us anything on the bus the driver communicated in Spanish that we were headed 1 hour 40 mins away to downtown Lima in rush hour traffic. It took two hours to check into the hotel where one of the passengers passed out and needed medical attention just so we could leave three hours later to travel back to the airport where they made us stand in line again to check in for the flight. I encountered around 100 LAN staff members and not one was helpful. I would ask a question and they would say they had to find out the answer and disappear. Nobody helped with connections everybody was on their own. Submitted a complaint to customer service and the response took almost three weeks and was in Spanish go figure!

After purchasing our tickets four months ago my wife and I have not only had our itineraries changed four times but we've been placed us on separate flights after we've repeatedly requested being on the same flight. Furthermore their justification for placing us on separate flights ended up being completely false and likely motivated by their overbooking our flight. Our flight leaving Buenos Aires had a layover in Santiago Chile. I was told that I had to have my flight changed because I would not make my connecting flight. My wife who also left on the same flight from Buenos Aires was given a non-changing flight that continued back to the US after the stop in Santiago. The fact that we both originated on the same flight but she was given a continuation and I was told I had to board another flight makes their reasoning behind placing me on another flight completely false. The only rational is that they overbooked the continuing flight and they were attempting to remove people from this flight to accommodate additional passengers in Chile. In trying to get them to rectify this error they simply removed both of us and placed us on earlier flights with an additional stop in another country after a six hour layover. They have no regard for their customers and do not try to honor their contracts. I understand a few changes in a flight but they have changed our flights multiple times with little or no regard to us as customers or the plans we've made.

I went to Rio Negro airport, which serves Medellin, and requested an emergency row seat which reclines, in fluent Spanish. The rep said that she could not give me one because 'you speak very little Spanish and have a passport from another country'. I was floored and finaly spoke with her for a few minutes whereupon she realized that she had probably misheard me. I speak Spanish as is heard in Bogota and not with a regional dialect. She quickly apologized and gave me a seat in the emergency row. Then onward to gate 5 for the 2:15 PM flight to Bogota. It appeared that our airplane, upon landing in Rio Negro, sustained a bird strike. It was up to the four young woman to tell more than 150 people a series of statements none of which matched. They admitted there was a bird strike and that we would have updated information. Everyone was hovering over the small desk where the four of them were. I heard four versions from (translated) 'an hour at the most' 'we don't know' 'there will be an update at 4:40 PM' and I forget the last one. My point is that there was clearly no one who could handle any type of crowd control, nor work with three sets of passengers, ie those going to Bogota, those with transfers in Bogota for national destination c those with international connection in Bogota The woman who spoke the most told me to tell my friend (at 3 PM) and who had a 6 PM flight to Madrid with another airline to return to the desk at 4 PM. I told her that would not give him enough time . She stated again that he return at 4 PM. At 3:50 she asked that I tell my friend to come to the desk, ostensibly to send him on another flight. He missed his connection. I finally got on a very crowded LAN flight at 5:30 and noticed that LAN had wedged in even more seats than ever. I was happy to get on the flight but I don't plan on using LAN again. The woman sitting next to me said that she would be put up in a hotel (she had a national destination with a change of planes in Bogota). She was offered no compensation. She stated that it had happened before but she wasn't really phased; another passenger said that he was offered a hotel and seventy dollars. My point is that there doesn't seem to be anyone , or in this situation, anyone capable of dealing with a group of people, all of whom were getting more an more nervous, in an orderly way. Rather than swarm the desk, someone with experience could have sat people down in the large area at gate 5 and stated the same thing. There was a birdstrike, we don't make the decisions but will keep you informed as we are told what to do, and to perhaps segregate those traveling to other national destinations from Bogota in one area, international from Bogota in another area, and to Bogota in another area. There was plenty of room to do this. This would have prevented the constant swarming of the desk, the yelling, (one of the four attendants was visibly upset, I spoke with her as she was put in an impossible situation), The tight seats were an indication of cost cutting. No water, no coffee, no nothing, but that could be because it was a full flight. I have seen LAN economy class go downhill, seat pitch become smaller and smaller.

Although the seat pitch on the Peru domestic flights was acceptable the pitch on the international Lima to La Paz flight was so narrow that I couldn't even open my laptop (and it was a very expensive flight!). Also long queues are to be expected for the morning flights in Lima and Cusco (Lan used the web check-in as a way to reduce their staff not as a way to increase the speed of the check-in) however they will call the passengers for the flights which take-off shortly. Snacks for the domestic flights are also of the cheapest sort and they only serve orange juice (no apple no tomato nothing...). As a conclusion LAN Peru is well organized and provides punctual and efficient service but they definitively are on a profit spree enjoying their monopoly to cut some corners without fear or shame while charging quite high prices.,0,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

The crew were polite and food was good. EZE-LIM was 2 hours 45 minutes late with no explanation meaning we didn't arrive into Lima until 2 am. However we were given a free meal at the airport.

However we massive legroom at the front in the middle so we were able to get some sleep. The cabin crew were good actually making sure people watched the safety video and food was fine. LIM-MIA however was great. It left roughly on time which was good as we had a connection at MIA to LHR (our bags did make it the whole way).

Although my Swiss ticket clearly included checked baggage, LATAM refused to honor it at MDZ. They claimed the baggage allowance only applied if I were flying directly with Swiss. Despite explaining that on my outbound trip I had no issues (because I boarded with Swiss), LATAM still made me pay an extra fee on the return segment. To make matters worse, LATAM issued only my first boarding pass (MDZ to GRU), insisting they are “not Swiss.” Because of this, I had to exit the terminal in each connecting airport, go through passport control, check in again at the counter, and clear security once more just to get my next boarding pass. It’s astonishing that they sell the entire connection together yet don’t consider baggage allowances, won’t print all boarding passes, and completely ignore any Swiss frequent flyer privileges. Seat selection was another frustration: unless you pay extra, you’re stuck in the middle seat. LATAM’s customer service was unhelpful, dismissive, and showed no willingness to coordinate with Swiss or resolve these issues.

Last month, after teaching in Colombia through COVID, our son booked his return to Sydney on LATAM. The party was three: his wife, their one year-old son and he. The route was Bogota to Santiago on one flight and then a second flight Santiago to Sydney. The Santiago to Sydney flight makes a “technical” refuelling stop in Auckland. Strangely, the New Zealand authorities require a transit visa for the Auckland stop. Australians don’t need one. My son’s Colombian wife did. LATAM never told her. Twenty-four hours before their flights were scheduled to leave Bogota, the family sought to check in on-line. They could not check in our daughter-in-law because “there could be outstanding documents”. No details. When, next day, the party sought to check in for the initial Bogota/Santiago flight, LATAM refused to book in our daughter-in-law in as she did not have a transit visa for NZ – which was, after all, on a separate flight. The requirement was news to the family. How long would that take? Perhaps 20 minutes. They figured that if the visa did not come through before the flight to Santiago, it might by the time they reached Santiago. If not, they could stay in Santiago. LATAM refused their request for the family to travel to Santiago - even though no visa of any sort was required for them to do so. These were regular tickets. No discounts involved. The visa for our daughter-in-law did not arrive before the flight to Santiago closed. LATAM documentation shows each member of the family as a “No Show”. This is clearly untrue. Because our son needed to get to Sydney for work, through LATAM they rebooked code-share LATAM/Qantas tickets for flights two days later. The original tickets had cost $5500. LATAM charged an additional $3400, no less. Both the original flights and the rebooked flights had many unfilled seats. LATAM was never going to be out of pocket. This must happen all the time. There may be modest costs involve in re-issuing the tickets – but $3400 extra is ridiculous and usurious. To date LATAM has refused any refund.

Just a few centimeters.  The weight of the dogs including the carriers were 7 kg and 5 kg. And most importantly, after Sao Paulo we immediately had a flight to Istanbul and then from Istanbul to St. Petersburg! So we lost all our tickets. We travel with our dogs and always use the same carriers and we have never ever had any problems! But what’s absolutely crazy is that we flew to Santiago a year ago with these same dogs by LATAM. By the way, during the flight the crew was very strict and didn’t even allow me to bend down, stick my hand into the carrier and just pet the dog. when I told the employee that these dogs had already flown with LATAM in the same carrier a year ago, she told me “well, maybe your dogs have grown over the past year.” I said that my dogs are 8 years old, they haven't grown for a long time, and what she said is incredibly stupid! But she didn't care! So I lost all my tickets and had no choice but to look for another airline company and buy new tickets and spend a lot of money again. LATAM didn’t refund a single cent to me!  We ended up traveling with Sky Airline, Iberia and Turkish Airlines. If my dogs ​​and their carriers were really big, these companies wouldn't accept my dogs, would they?

This whole experience with LATAM makes me know I will never come to this country again. First of all, please be very careful flying domestic airlines in Bogota. They will keep changing the gate number last minute and you will have no idea. In certain areas you can’t hear the speakers. I was supposed to be at gate C2 to Cartagena at 12:34 flight. Because they changed the gate, I was there two hours ahead of time, I missed my flight. I asked them at the counter, they told me I had to go back out and speak to a representative. I went out, this airline is affiliated with Delta. Even though they knew I was a gold Medallion member, they said they couldn’t do anything and I had to go to ticketing. Now, during this time, no one is telling my luggage hasn’t gone on the flight. I speak to the ticketing area, I find out that there are 3 other people who missed their flight because of the gate change. And the ticketing lady says for a 9 pm flight there are seats but I have to pay another $150. I could get a cheaper flight on another airline and she told me to do this. Again, she never tells me my luggage is still in Bogota. I catch a 7:30 flight on Wingo that left an hour late, only to find out when I get to Cartagena that my luggage isn’t here and the 6-7 reps that are at the latam podium state they can’t help me.

891670,2024-03-26,E Milleau,True,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Easter Island to Santiago,March 2024,2,2,2,1,no,Worst customer service,"Worst customer service of any airline we have flown. 3 of us were booked in business class on a flight from Easter Island (Rapa Nui) to Santiago. The flight ended up delayed by 15 1/2hrs due to a cargo door and engine issue. After an initial delay of 3 1/2 hrs, an announcement was made that the flight was cancelled and all passengers were to go to the check-in to get rebooked. It was utter chaos as we were told every flight for the next 3 days was fully booked and that we were on our own to find accommodation and transportation for an unknown duration on this small isolated island. LATAM refused to be responsible for accommodation because there were ""too many passengers for staff to arrange accommodation with the limited accommodations on the island."" but the passengers were expected to find accommodation on their own?? An announcement was made stating that we would receive compensation for hotel/food for each passenger and the monies would go directly to our LATAM wallet within 24hrs. With virtually no internet, limited cell service, and zero assistance from staff, we were finally able to secure the last 2 rooms in the hotel we had previously stayed in. We were informed by WhatsApp 7 1/2hrs after our original expected departure that a new flight was scheduled for 05:00 the following morning. When we arrived at 02:30 to check in, the airport was empty of staff but dozens of overtired, stressed passengers were already waiting in line. No one in line had received any compensation from LATAM and several were quite upset. We were assured again by staff that the funds would show up in our LATAM wallet and then we could transfer the funds to our bank accounts to cover costs incurred. No funds were ever issued by LATAM. They left hundreds of passengers stranded with no accommodations, no food and no transportation for what turned out to be over 15hr delay for most passengers, with many other passengers delayed for days as this plane was smaller. When we finally boarded and departed, no food was served and towards the end of the flight, business class passengers were going up one by one asking for food only to be given a single yogurt and a juice. When one passenger asked for coffee, they were told they were ""out of coffee"" - how was that possible when no drinks or food had even been served during the flight?? When I reached out to LATAM through several different avenues, I was ignored and finally told that we received a voucher at the airport and so our claim for compensation was denied. We never received anything from LATAM nor the LATAM staff at the Rapa Nui airport. LATAM customer service in Santiago Airport was atrocious. After our Easter Island flight delay, we had missed our rebooked connector and when we tried to get the connector changed, we were accused of being at fault for missing our flight and told we would have to pay for a new flight until I pointed out that the 12 people standing behind us were on the same delayed flight. overall in 6 flight segments we flew with LATAM on this trip, only one was on time and boarding was always chaotic. Five of our six flight segments were premium or business and we rarely felt this was much of an upgrade. Save your $$ and book with JetSmart.",1,1,1,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

889876,2024-03-03,M Doyle,True,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Arenas to San Francisco,February 2024,2,3,1,1,no,Completely disjointed and disorganized,"Completely disjointed and disorganized ticketing/reservation system. We called their customer service so many times before our flight to make sure things were set after literally several reschedulings of our flights in the months leading up to our trip and we ultimately chose new flights for our itinerary. This caused so many issues with reticketing in their system that we did not find out about until our return trip. We couldn’t check-in, we couldn’t purchase bags online, and they completely messed up the final connection from LAX to SFO. For whatever reason, none of the flight agents at the check-in counters or customer service could find our LAX-SFO leg in the system even though we have the electronic tickets issued with numbers as well as receipts for the whole itinerary. As a result, they could only check our bags through to LAX and not SFO. We ended up spending over an hour during each layover and connection with check-in assistance or the customer service counter, even though our connections were short. Created a lot of stress around whether our bags would make it at all and if we would even make the next flight because the check-in agents were having trouble. On the final leg with Delta (codeshared with LATAM) I was stopped during boarding because my ticket was reissued sometime during the layover and became invalid. When the gate agent tried to pull my name up, she couldn’t find my ticket anymore. It was absolutely bizarre because my husband’s ticket was scanned with no issue. Took over 20 minutes of waiting and hand wringing and calls by the gate agent to fix the ticketing issue so I could get on the plane. LATAM’s system for handling ticketing is god-awful and the whole triaging process by their customer service is so slow and unhelpful. The Santiago International customer service desk spent most of their time trying to fix their backpack and clicked around looking confused for a solid 45 minutes before saying anything to us about what was happening. She asked us why WE canceled our LAX-SFO flight, which threw us into a panic because we obviously had done nothing of the sort and were desperately trying to get our tickets for the flight printed. We did our best to use Google Translate and speak in our (broken) Spanish but it would’ve been helpful if the agents could communicate at least a BIT in English. After another 20 minutes of silence from the agent clicking around, she finally told us to go to the check-in assistance counter before they closed because our flight was boarding in 30 minutes. Absolutely absurd — no help at all and she should’ve directed us there from the start. Additionally, it seems to be a known issue among the agents and based on customer reviews that the online system for pre purchasing checked bags does NOT work. But they seem to just accept it so you’re forced to pay the premium at the airport rather than honoring the online price. Food was absolutely awful on all the flights and they didn’t even offer snacks during the long-haul, international flights. Delta staff for our Delta connections were fantastic, on the other hand.

Because of that, they are not able to understand what we are saying very well in the US. They also don't have a good online booking process. Here are all my issues with LATAM: 1. I paid for baggage fees in both directions for my flight. The reservation site has a single check for baggage fee. Naturally, I assume that it pays for both directions 2. I called to change my return flight. I specifically asked the agent to confirm that the baggage fees for the return would be transferred to the modified return flight, and the agent confirmed that it is indeed paid for both directions. I think this is probably where the trouble started. My assumptions is that when it is not a round trip, they probably charge extra baggage fee, but they are not clearly calling this out. 3. Everything went fine until I tried to get on my return flight. They told me my return baggage fees is not paid. I had to pay a very high baggage fees, which is nearly double the normal fee if I had paid upfront. Even if the reservation agent had understood me well, and informed me that I had not paid for the second segment when I made the reservation change, I would have taken care of it before getting to the airport. 4. I created a ""case"" on their support site to get this resolved. I explained the entire story and even uploaded the tickets, and the confirmation of the reservation change etc. After one day, I simply got an email from an agent called Alexander Vélez, saying that the baggage was only paid in one direction; and the case was simply closed!

Around 22.00 I woke up and a couple sitting next to me mentioned we are landing as an emergency in Rio de Janeiro, I was shocked and thought they were joking. And they repeat they have to change due to weather conditions. We are on our way to Rio de Janeiro, from that moment I knew this would be a hell of a journey. We landed in Rio de Janeiro and the crew said they have to change because by law they have completed the time established at work. First thing, passengers don't need to leave the plane because the change of crew is coming, and we will fly back to São Paulo. We waited in the plane for one hour, after that around 23:30 we have to get out and wait without knowing how long we would be waiting. I decided during that time to speak to one of the staff from LATAM, and mentioned I have a flight to London at 23:45, obviously I missed this flight and I will need to know what would happen next. The staff said don't worry, we will wait a few hours here and once we get to São Paulo you should request a new flight to reach your final destination. Around 02:00 AM we boarded again the flight and flew to São Paulo arriving at 03:43 AM, I go to the LATAM office, explained what happened and showed my boarding pass. Staff said you should go to the office on ground floor, they will reissue a new boarding pass for you.

When we approached the gate, the attendant refused to issue us the proper tag for our stroller, stating that we should just place it in our overhead compartment. When we walked up to the airplane door, we were approached by another employee of the airline, who said that we can't bring the stroller with us into the aircraft, and promised to issue an appropriate tag once she took the stroller off our hands. I felt suspicious when she came back with the white tag instead of the pink one. It wasn't until later we realized that she issued a wrong tag and sent our stroller straight to our final destination - San Francisco. When we landed in Sao Paulo for our layover, we were waiting for our stroller to be returned to us at the gate, but it never arrived. The staff was unhelpful, stating that they didn't have it and didn't know where to look for it either. They refused to call anywhere to make inquiries on our behalf. They simply turned their backs to us and walked away. They treated us like we were some sort of nuisance that they wanted out of their space as quickly as possible. We were exhausted, confused, and frustrated. We were forced to rush into the baggage claim with a sleeping toddler in our arms in the middle of the night, and our hands full with our carry-on bags. When we finally reached the baggage conveyor, the attendant stated that we had a wrong tag and our stroller was sent directly to San Francisco. Who in the world sends a motion-assistance device all the way to the final destination?? I purchased the stroller for this airplane trip specifically, so that our toddler son can get some rest in the airport in-between the 4(!) flights that we had to take to return home, but the stroller was just taken away from us by a person who doesn't know how to handle them correctly. This is the same as making a disabled person run around the airport trying to locate their wheelchair and subsequently being told they can't have it until they complete their journey. I was shocked and appalled by how our family was treated by the airline. When we reached the LATAM check-in counter in São Paulo airport, the employee on duty confirmed what we suspected: we have been misled by the airline workers. The employees we spoke to prior to this moment knew exactly what happened to the stroller: the luggage tag is always white, and the stroller gate check tag is always pink. They willingly made us run around the airport while holding a sleeping child, because they didn't want to do the work of correcting the mistake of the gate attendant in Joao Pessoa. I was shocked and appalled by the lack of professionalism that we faced during our journey. This experience left me feeling disrespected as a customer, as well as an individual. The airline made it very clear that they have zero regards for the health and experience of their customers, regardless of their age group. I'm utterly disgusted that my 1.5 years old son was treated in this manner. All my attempts to contact the airline to make things right were fruitless. The customer service representative simply hung up on me when I called. Avoid them like a plague.

The unannounced filming not only invaded passengers' privacy but also caused a significant delay in our flight, disregarding our time and schedules. The crew's activities created a distressing atmosphere, and issues with seat functionality added to the discomfort. Moreover, the delay in service due to staff involvement in filming left passengers confused and dissatisfied, with no clear explanation or resolution from the airline. Despite reaching out to Latam Airlines for a resolution, the response has been lacking. It's disheartening when an airline fails to address such grievances promptly and adequately. Overall, my experience was subpar, and I hope Latam Airlines takes these concerns seriously to improve their service quality for future passengers. Sanjay Chadha",2,1,1,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

The real problem is if you need to make any changes to your ticket, you are really doomed. Let me explain why. I had to change the tickets dates for me, my kids and my mother in March 2023. Every time I called it was a different problem. Every single time they encountered a problem in the system. Every time I called (same day) the fare would have a different price, it would vary from 2k to 3k and then $700 on the same day (this is only the fare difference on the ticket I have already purchased). I know the fare changes constantly, but it didnt make sense .. every representative would give me a insane price every time I called. The changing fee would be different on every call.. on one call he said there would be no fee, another one told me it would be $150, and then $300 and $450 .. no consistency. Even when I agreed to pay a lot more for the fare difference the system would not process the payment and I would have to call back later and go through the same process over and over again. Also, my mother was on a different reservation so I had to double the calls because they could not resolve everything in a single call always saying the system was down or payment could not be processed at that time. After several calls the problem was resolved at 2am. Don't get me wrong, the customer service representatives are polite and friendly but they cannot help! Fast forward to June I had to change my mother's reservation again. When I booked her ticket several months ago, I bought a more expensive ticket so we could have flexibility on changes, and it was the same nonsense. Several calls, crazy fare changes and to put the ticket on hold they wanted to charge me $450 + changing fees, + the fare difference whenever I book in the future.. so it was better just not show up for this flight and buy a new ticket with another airline company.

I've never been on an international business class flight where this had happened. The crew was completely missing in action. I have no idea what they were doing but they did nothing customer facing for three hours - this was a $1000 return ticket? This is the equivalent to going to a very expensive restaurant and prepaying for the meal and having nobody approach your table with any kind of greeting or service for three hours. It's outrageous. I talked to the purser about it before the flight ended and she was unapologetic and had lame excuses such as they can't do anything for 30 minutes while over the Andes which I totally understand but she didn't address the lack of service while on the ground for two hours because there was no defense. The SCL crews are very arrogant and the airline should be ashamed of themselves.

Cabin was fine, with middle seat blocked out. We were given pillow, blanket and a small amenity kit which I wasn’t expecting. The flight attendant for our cabin introduced himself to each passenger and said to let him know how he could help. Breakfast was served and then I had a couple of beers. I had a question about luggage transfer at BOG and the attendant went out of his way to get me an answer.

835810,2023-02-24,Anton Vavilov,True,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Medellin to Bogota,February 2023,2,2,1,1,no,turned into seven hours of hell,"That was supposed to be a short 30 minutes flight trip which turned into seven hours of hell. First of all, to check in our bag at Medellin airport we had to queue for 1.5 hours, as there is a lot of Latam staff at the airport but they are normally too busy to chat with each other. Secondly, after security check completed, just before boarding time, we found out that our flight had been cancelled. All the passengers approached the lady who was registering passengers at another gate for another flight. She helped a few who had connections and asked others to return back to check in area to reschedule the flight. The majority of passengers who did not have the luggage could just reschedule their flights online without leaving the gate area and queuing up again. Yes, this is where another minus one star from the rating is coming. Three ladies who for some reason were standing together at one counter to regulate the queue found a brilliant solution asking all the passengers of the cancelled flight queue to the check in counters again. At some point, I connected to the airport WiFi and helped some passengers to reschedule their flights online without queuing up, so they could go to do their security check again and return to the gates area. The fourth lady (as three others were again busy chatting and laughing in the middle of this chaos) who was walking in the queue was very surprised it was possible to reschedule the flight online. Passengers with the luggage were expected to pick up their bags and re-check in them again. Our problem was they could not find our bag. After a few attempts the check-in representative suggested that it might went to Bogota (how? on cancelled flight?) as they cannot allocate it in Medellin, and he suggested that the bag will fly on the same plane with us, as I re-scheduled the flight online. Another minus one star for professionalism. Full of doubts we boarded the re-scheduled flight. Of course, our bag was not in Bogota upon arrival. Six people working at Latam Luggage Tracking kiosk could not allocate it and after exchanging a few calls with Medellin staff suggested to fill the form and promising our luggage will be delivered to London. This is when my trust in Latam ground staff fell below zero. Again, with mixed feelings of hopeless and doubts we filled the form, staff returned us a copy asking to check the status online. We decided to check the online service immediately and found out there was not a tracking or reference number on the form! The answer was appalling: ""Oh, we have not register your form online yet!"". Really? And how we were supposed to check the status online without tracking number? Another star off. Meanwhile next two Latam flights from Medellin arrived and whilst we were patiently asking the Latam staff to do their job, I turned around and found our bag among others from the next flight. Guess what? Another passenger's luggage tag were attached to our bag! Latam, is it safe? Is it professional? Of course, nobody from Luggage Tracking kiosk could answer how come the other passenger's name tag was on our bag. They just pretended they did not hear that question. The passenger's problem is up to the passenger to solve it. And lack of investment in staff is shocking.",1,0,0,A319,LATAM Airlines

So I provided LATAM Airlines with the information and evidence they needed and asked for a refund of both tickets. It was incredibly frustrating to communicate with their customer service. It was like 6 different people were handling my case, without communicating with each other. Several times I got send the same emails by different people, asking for information I already gave them. Either they did not understand or did not want to understand me. To be honest, at a certain point, I got the feeling that all this confusion was on purpose, just to discourage me from getting my refunds back (also based on reading reviews from other passengers). You're supposed to be a professional airline. You can't be this incompetent, can you? Eventually, I got a full refund for one ticket, which is good, but I still lost € 545.97. At this point, I'm just too tired to pursue it anymore, so all I can do is warn my fellow traveler. If the flight goes well, be happy.

I do not recommend flying with LATAM if you will have multiple connections or if you're booking out far enough in advance that flight times, etc. might change because it will be nearly impossible to get your itinerary corrected. I purchased my flights directly through LATAM from SAN to LAX to SCL. When it came time to check in for my flight (18 hours before take off) I was unable to check in for my flight; it was impossible via the app and online. I called the LATAM support line and they were able to confirm that the error was an internal booking error (i.e. 100% LATAM's fault) which resulted in me not actually having a seat on the first flight. None of the four reps that I talked to (over four hours) could change the ticket or help me out. They told me that my options were to: 1) Cancel my ticket and be refunded, 2) I could pay to 'change' my flights, or 3) they could open a case and someone would call me eventually. A case was opened, however no one called me within the next 12 hours (at which point my flight was 6 hours from takeoff). I called them again (two hours this time) and confirmed with them what my options were and they confirmed that one of them was cancelling the ticket for a refund, so I told them that I wanted to get a refund for my ticket. Suddenly, this was no longer an option and the person couldn't explain why and also couldn't do anything else. The advice that the rep gave me was to ""be patient"" which I find unacceptable. They said I could 'try going to the connecting airport and check in there to see what happens,"" although they separately indicated that if I 'missed' my first flight then the entire trip would be cancelled. About an hour before my first flight was scheduled to take off, I got an email that said ""we tried to reach you"" to address the case however I had no missed calls and it had no instructions to get in touch with them again. I never received a follow up. Even if they had called, it would have been too late to make it to the airport for my flight on time (even if I was standing in the airport lobby when I answered the call) which is unacceptable. I gave LATAM $1200 for a ticket and only gave me headaches and stress.  Their customer service team is not able to fix even basic issues and the customer is expected to pay for the airline's errors. Customer service reps also feel free to hang up on you which happened to me at least three times. I ended up having to buy a whole new ticket for my trip which was almost 2x my original price since, as you can imagine, buying an international flight on the day of the trip isn't going to be cheaper than the original. LATAM's flight schedule changes (a whole other issue that I didn't discuss here, but which cost me and my six travel buddies each 6+ hours on the phone with LATAM) and their other errors cost me $1000+ USD beyond the cost of the initial ticket that I booked.",2,3,1,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Just now, nearly four weeks after voicing a concern and 3 weeks after my booked flight took to the air, I am hearing back. In short, I was in Ecuador with a planned flight from Quito to Guayaquil, roundtrip. Do to some major travel complications, including but not limited to civil unrest in Guayaquil, we were going to miss our initial flight. Two of us tried reaching out via Help Center, Email, WhatsApp, and phone call and never heard back. One of us finally got on the phone - after 30 minutes on hold with international rates - to voice our concerns and the representative, 10 minutes into our claim, hung up on us. We were prepared to sacrifice missing the first leg but wanted to ensure that we could still utilize our return flight (Guayaquil to Quito). Instead of responding to any of our claims (attempted almost daily for a week straight) or listening when we did finally get ahold of someone, they cancelled our reservation and kept our money. We were forced to take an overnight bus - as all other flights were fully booked - which cut into a significant part of our travels. As a travel and tourism professional, working in the industry for many years now, I was taken aback at how inaccessible, inflexible, and ultimately unhelpful LATAM was throughout the entire process.

Subsequently, the trip was cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I called LATAM and was told that I could hold open my ticket until the next year. My tour was rescheduled for June 2021 and I rebooked flights on LATAM. The 2021 trip was also cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I spoke by phone with a LATAM agent who told me my ticket would be held open until June 13, 2020. My tour was rescheduled by the tour company for June 2022. In early March 2022, I began trying to rebook my flights. This turned out to be an absolute nightmare and ultimately unsuccessful. I lost track of the number of attempts I made to rebook this ticket, but it had to be over 20. For about a week, I made several calls daily that resulted in waiting for extremely long times for my call to be answered, only to be cut off. I waited about a week before I started calling again. Now my calls were answered, but I couldn’t believe I was dealing with the same airline I had dealt with in 2020 and 2021. With one or two exceptions, every agent had such poor English that it was extremely difficult to communicate, I never really felt they understood what I wanted, and I, in turn, could barely understand them. Several times, I had to tell someone that I would just have to try another agent. The background noise level was extreme. I had to terminate several calls because it was impossible to hear. With one exception, the agents did not seem to know how to do their job. They told me, variously: that I should use the LATAM website (not seeming to know that you can’t use an open ticket on the website, nor book legs on other airlines), that it was not possible to rebook my ticket, that the flight I wanted did not exist (when I was looking at it on the website), that it was impossible to book SMF-LAX with them (after hearing that several times, I dropped the SMF-LAX portion and just focused on LAX-LIM), that I would have to go from LAX to LIM via Santiago and Miami, in that order (two agents told me this). Finally, I got an agent with good English on a clear line, who was able to book exactly what I wanted. When we were nearly finished, he put me on hold - and the call was dropped. That was when I gave up and bought tickets online. I had to book the SMF-LAX leg separately on another airline. I sent all the above information to the airline with my request for a refund of the $2198.09 I'd paid for the original ticket. After a very long time, they told me I could not have a refund because I'd been told in the beginning that I should rebook my open ticket.",0,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

Unfortunately when we got to the hotel the hotel had no rooms and they claimed LATAM never confirmed any of the bookings with them. LATAM was unreachable to resolve this problem. We tried on social media channels and five different phone numbers. Basically all of us were left to fend for ourselves. Ultimately secured my own room at another hotel and got myself there. Zero chance of being reimbursed by LATAM who refuses to respond to my queries on Twitter. At GRU was told there is not one person who could help resolve this despite it being a hub airport - they said I have to call them - we tried multiple times with no success.

They do not let you stand up altogether after the plane is secured at the gate, and instead require you to stand only by aisle/row. And they are currently requiring a double face mask mandate, even when traveling to or landing in a country which does not require any such mandate. We felt like we were being governed by a police force when on a domestic flight we, in Row 3, tried to stand and get our carry-on luggage. A flight attendant absolutely refused let us stand, and stated that only Row 1 could stand up at that time. On an international flight, Rows 1 - 18 were allowed to stand and get their luggage, but our Row 22 could not. We have never before seen an airline regulate when specific rows of passengers can get their luggage once the plane is securely docked at the gate. During our travel, Peru and LATAM Airlines required a two face mask mandate in all airports and on all airplanes. When we were returning to the United States, they still required this mandate, even though we were in U.S. airspace and landing at a U.S. airport.

Ground service started by making us wait in 3 different lobbies before putting us in a extremely full and hot bus that did not depart for another 30 minutes.

Couldn't they just make us wait the whole lot in one single place and only put us on the bus when it was ready to leave to the plane? Seats were grimy, upholstery is uncomfortably hard and - despite being a small woman, I found the seats to be very small, just as the ones in domestic flights. I found the window technology - where it's not controlled by the person seated on the window sit - very annoying. It is fine to turn it dark after providing the first meal, but not immediately. Leaving Sydney at 10am and having the windows turned dark as soon as the air plane took off was very uncomfortable and unnecessary. They should leave each person to control at least in the first 2 hours and last 2 hours of the flight, when everyone is awake. The food provided was not tasty or enough. Their tiny cheese & ham croissant with a little pot of fruits ARE NOT enough when the next meal will be in 10 hours! And when the next meal came, it was also tiny and hospital-like.

After all, it was the same airlines and other airlines had done that when the flight was delayed! To my horror, I was told when we landed in Guayaquil that sorry, nothing they could do, and that there was no communication from anyone. I asked the ground staff for the later flight, and I was ok with a connection at Miami, under American Airlines (Same partner), they said they couldnt do that, as it was delayed due to the wind, not their fault, it is too expensive for them to pay American Airlines. They offered airport hotel and issued next day economy ticket to me instead (my original business class ticket). After I asked again, they changed my ticket to business class I was brought to hotel shuttle, I asked multiple times to LATAM staff if the hotel was aware with me checking in and I was assured the hotel would give me a room as soon as I arrived and again not to worry.

I was traveling with a group of 6 people (all U.S. Citizens). We had confirmed tickets from Lima to Cusco round trip. We arrived early at the airport just to make sure we have time in case we encounter any problems as we are in a foreign country, we preferred to take precautions just in case. Once we arrived at the counter to process our check in they told us our seats had been sold and that we had to wait for the next flight. We were very upset as we had not been notified at all of any changes regardless of the reason. They offered us a credit with the airline of $40 or a cash voucher of $20. We really didn't want either as it was cutting short our much waited vacation which we had look forward to enjoy for a year and now we are being literally forced to cut it short for $20 in exchange. Really.! Anyway, since they did not give us another option no matter how many times we said no, we took the $20 cash voucher. Here comes the worst part ... they told us that we could go to any LATAM agency and that they would exchange the voucher for cash, as the counter at the airport was not authorized to do that.  So, we went to the LATAM office in Cusco and they told us that only in Lima could be done. Upon our return to Lima we went to the LATAM agency in Chacarilla, but they told us that they couldn't do it and that we had to go to a different agency in Miraflores. We then proceeded to go to the agency in Miraflores on our last day before our departure back to the US and they proceeded to tell us that they couldn't process the request as it had to be done over the phone. It has been 5 months since that day and in the interim we have been communicating with their ""Customer Service"" department. We have been changed at least 7 times of representative and every time they ask us for passports, copies of IDs, notarized letters to approve disbursement of funds for our children voucher credit, more questions and more emails. Once we thought we finally were done, and we would finally get our credit they said they needed an account in Soles, which is the Peruvian currency. Now, why in hell would they give a voucher that specifically reads $20 (dollars) if when you redeem it you need an account in a different currency! Anyway, I was able to contact a friend in Peru that was willing to provide me with her account information for the deposit to be done in her account for her then to transfer the funds. LATAM then said that needed another letter approving such transaction, we did, we sent them once again what they requested. This was followed by a response saying that only 5 vouchers will be credited, the other one was missing a voucher number. That was 45 days ago and we still haven't received any credit. I then received an automatic email saying that if I wanted to receive the funds I had to complete their forms again because they voucher was going to expire. Then I email them again asking where my ""approved credit"" was and they ignored my question by saying please provide copy of passport, ID, notarized letter, etc etc etc etc etc. This is beyond ridiculous and a joke of customer service, I don't do all this for $20, it is a matter of principle.

Therefore I requested mobility assistance well in advance of my scheduled flight. I provided government issued documentation to the effect. LATAM confirmed within a timely manner by email and assigned seats in advance, in accordance with German law. When I arrived at the designated check-in desk for the disabled at Frankfurt Airport, the check-in agent behaved rude and unprofessional. He insisted on collecting a surplus charge and tried to deny me my preassigned seat, which is unlawful. I asked repeatedly to speak to the flight manager; my request was outright denied. At this point in time, I could hardly stand any longer. The staff could not care any less. To make things worse, they even canceled out my advance seat reservation for the return flight, for no other reason, but to annoy me and to aggravate me.

After a very positive flight from Frankfurt to Madrid, am profoundly disappointed by LATAM. Delayed my luggage three days (according to them 48 hours) and asked me to take a taxi from Osnabrück to FMO airport because they do not have an arrangement with Lufthansa for baggage delivery. The cost of a round-trip taxi is 175€. I tried to mitigate the cost by renting a car for the weekend (it's 64€ v. renting a car for three hours is 20€ more) and parked the car in my driveway for the weekend. I saved LATAM 111€ yet they offered me only 18€ for the car hire even though they'd agreed to pay for my round trip taxi (the funny thing is that I spoke to a Lufthansa Mitarbeiterin at FMO and she told me that if LATAM had simply asked them to deliver the suitcase - as is normal procedure with delayed baggage across the industry -- they would've made the arrangements and would've invoiced LATAM the cost. I told LATAM that if they are going to land in Germany and delay their customer's baggage they'd better come to an agreement with the German carriers to delivery their misdirected luggage). My ex-husband had convinced me that LATAM has ripped me off and it is better for my mental health to let go of it but I am having second thoughts about filing a court action against them. Until they are corrected, they will continue to mistreat the traveling public.

The meal itself though was the worst I have ever had on an airline. White rice with a few diced tomato pieces and grilled zucchini. Absolutely flavorless, dry, and zucchini tasted of plastic.

At no point was I given the actual tracking number that the claim was being processed under, and was forced to call a service line later that evening to be given the process by which to track my luggage.

Catering and service aboard the flight was excellent, however I do not understand how a new airplane - Boeing 787 - has seats that do not function. My first seat in row 1 had a faulty entertainment system, so I gathered my things and moved to row 3 -- there, the seat did not recline or move at all. I declined to move a third time. Return flight not so good. The agent at the priority check-in (am AA Platinum) insisted that I pay 10€ to have my suitcase wrapped in plastic b/c there was an exposed edge on my suitcase and he said it would damage other suitcases in the hold (a first for me after 40 years of flying). I waited 75"" at Frankfurt Airport and no suitcase. There was another suitcase similarly wrapped in the claim area and the agent thinks that mine had been taken home in error. By the time i'd made the report (I'd warned that agent after 75"" of waiting that I had a train to catch) I rushed to the Fernbahnhof but missed my train, and so had to grapple with the Deutsche Bahn staff to be put on the next train which had me home three hours late. I tried to access the Latam site as quoted on the claim receipt (LATAM.com/BAGAGEM) but that page doesn't exist. Called the phone number on the receipt but the recorded message told me to go to the airline's webpage (now that's certainly not getting anywhere). So, I am here in Osnabrück for my ex-husband's 60th birthday party (a formal catered affair at a fancy hotel) with nothing to wear and what's worse is that my medicine is in the suitcase.

Upon taking our seats we were offered Champagne or water and a bowl of nuts to nibble. The seats were similar in layout and operation to other airlines such as LOT and offered the option of a full recline into a fully flat bed. The pitch was more than adequate. The TV was operated either by a handheld controller or by touch screen. The selection seemed fine (although I didn't take advantage of it, my wife managed a movie). We were taken back onto stand because of a late slot amendment owing to weather at Frankfurt. This delay was minimal however it did allow the cabin crew time to ply me with another cold Champagne (as a former Air Traffic Controller I abhor delays, however with Champagne, not so much). A short taxi and departure from one of the southeasterly runways and we were up. The lunch service started soon after take off. The food was very pleasant.

Disregarding the fact that just about all of our routes were delayed, our luggage was mishandled and lost en route to Buenos Aires. Although the wait was quite long reporting the luggage hadn’t been received at the airport, the ground staff were quite helpful. We received an allowance for the day which would have been fine if it wasn’t for one of the large denomination notes being an unusable counterfeit. We’re a family of four, traveling with a one year old and a four year old, none of our checked in luggage made it to our destination. In fact, it took three days for us to be re-united (fortunately) with our luggage. Having travelled extensively, I’m aware that airlines allow for compensation to travellers who purchase essentials (Clothes and cosmetics), should luggage be delayed or lost. I made sure I retained all slips of such items purchased. All seemed fine and my claim for this compensation was lodged in mid January 2019, not an insignificant amount given this was for the whole family for three days without any of our luggage. In the months since then, I have experienced nothing short of #incompetence, neglect, lies and deception from LATAM Airlines. It took a month before a formal letter for settlement for the claim was received, which was laughable in its value in relation to my expense which was well within the Montreal Convention provisions. The staff handling the case were so disorganised, they misplaced the proofs provided. After several promised deadlines were missed I then received a reasonable settlement letter which was signed and I was advised that payment will be fulfilled within 20 days. This after queries from staff suggested they had no clue on how to actually fulfil an international funds transfer. Unsurprisingly, a full month later (End March 2019), no payment was received. It took another month until early May for the airline to acknowledge an apparent system issue and advise that payment will reflect in a further 20 days. Don’t bother trying to get any information from their call centre, they are so clueless and disempowered, it actually got to a stage where the agent I was talking to could not help me or put a supervisor / manager on the phone. There was no further course of escalation, only a “note” on the system for the relevant department to contact me, which they never did, for weeks! No prizes, for guessing, the second official settlement advice and a further 20 day period elapsed with no payment received. We are now in June 2019, almost six months after the claim and more than three months after a legally binding settlement letter was received and agreed. What a shameful disgrace of an organisation.

As we were at the airport arriving from Cuzco the night before, the local agent said simply getting to the airport early and 3 hours before departure would ensure the ability to check in at the airport Kiosk. We had prepaid tickets and seat assignments. Upon check in at the airport in Lima early, 8:30 for our noon departure, we were told there were no seats for our 3 kids as the flight was oversold and my kids were bumped off the flight. They assured us that they would attempt to get volunteers off the flight to accommodate my kids. We spent 3 hours at the gate very stressed and upset. Luckily 2 seats became available.

At this point the flight was boarded and they told us to board. 5 of us went through the gate onto the plane and then they stopped my son and said he had no seat.

I cried the whole way home. They promised my son $300, but he had to fight to get $200 for spending money. They got him a hotel room and he had to leave back to the US the next day.  My travel agent and myself have tried to get through to the airlines about this situation, but they are indifferent and really don't care.

I then tried again willing to pay the A$100 fee to get a refund (it was a 'plus' ticket and this is in the policy). It turns out the 'plus' doesn't apply because the outbound flight was a 'light' fare, in which case the whole trip becomes 'light' (so why are they allowed to sell it in the first place???). This Black Friday is the biggest scam I've ever seen because the increase the prices the day before and then apply the discount on the increase prices, so the discount is not the percentage promised anyway. The prices increase during the sales period. There was no understanding of the situation or consideration for a client who just bought 13 flights from them and I'll never fly with them again.",0,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

I decided to give LATAM a second chance after a bad experience between Sao Paulo and Frankfurt two years ago. After all, they have new A350s to Paris, with their ""new"" Premium Business cabin and service. Check-in at the GRU was fast and efficient, but the Business class boarding pass was a piece of paper similar to a fast-food ticket. I was directed to a beautiful but crowded lounge with good little bites and drinks options. This time, getting on board was on time, and I found the wide cabin looking nice in the mood lighting and properly cleaned. A undrinkable ""welcome"" Chilean sparkling was served and the crew distributed menus and small amenity kit. Unfortunately, double seats (2-2-2 configuration) are not private at all and I had a very annoying passenger sitting next to me and complaining loudly about the poor food and service throughout the dinner time. I cannot blame him as the food was of very bad quality as well as the wines, certainly not suitable for a Premium Business class or even an international economy class. With everything in a little tray, which was dirty and well used with lots of cracks and tears, they served a choice between a simple salad or small soup, a hard loaf from the basket, the main course of braised beef with vegetables and a slice of canned pineapple. From the wine list of 3 red wines, 1 Argentinian and 2 Chilean, only one of the Chileans was available, a cheap and inedible, acid one. The two flight attendants were polite but unable to attend the full cabin of 30 passengers in a timely manner, and while they were trying to hurry, they often forgot items such as drinks, water, bread or jumping a few seats which left some passengers really upset. It was impossible to get a second round of water, (hard) bread or drinks, but for the low quality wine, I did not complain. After dinner, toilets were already so dirty with water on the floor and other debris, very disgusting, but deteriorated even more during the flight. For entertainment, no wifi, and the system loaded with some movies and music had to be restarted 3 or 4 times due to a malfunction. At least the seat was flat and the A350 is a wide aircraft with large windows and high ceiling and I was able to sleep for a few hours. In the morning, a terrible breakfast was served with a dry and tasteless omelette, a hard bread but okay small slices of fruit and coffee. Although it is a flight of almost 12 hours, no snacks were available or any kind of service provided during mid flight. Fortunately, the flight arrived on time and I was able to quickly connect with Aeroflot for a shorter flight but for a much better experience. I travel twice a year between Sao Paulo and Europe and use different airlines.

Then I find out on my trip that my two return flights with them were changed and literally all over the place. My first flight was now taking off when my last flight was supposed to and my middle flight was going in the opposite direction. I had to have my father call on my behalf, who was on the phone with them for roughly 3 hours trying to fix this and get me on the appropriate flights, which apparently would have cost over $2000 CAD, even though online told a much different story, but it doesn’t seem like they were willing to fix their mistakes. So I had to accept the only free flight change they were willing to offer me, which really wasn’t free since I needed an extra night at the hotel, and one layover went from 2 hours to 7 hours.

I would strongly recommend that you never use this airline. We are seasoned travelers and fly a lot with many different airlines but LATAM are by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. They are incompetent liars and when things go wrong their customer service is abysmal. I don’t know if they are purposely being completely ineffective hoping that I will give up or if they just don’t have the training and skills to deal with customers. I am surprised that they are allowed to be part of the one world alliance as they tarnish the brand. Every flight we have ever taken with them has been delayed and the check in process is chaos regardless of the airport, with long queues. On the 5th Sep we flew from Calama to Buenos Aires via Santiago. The time for boarding came and went without any announcement so we went to see what was happening. The ground staff were running around telling everyone that the flight was overbooked and couldn’t leave until they removed some bags and passengers. They were asking for passengers to volunteer not to take the flight so that it could depart. They were physically collecting people’s boarding passes from them. Initially they said they needed 20 passengers to volunteer in order for the flight to leave and then they said they needed an additional 12. We eventually left without a single seat spare. Then when we reached Santiago, my husband and I ran to the gate for our connection and reached there 1 hour before departure, as boarding was commencing but the LATAM staff refused us access to our flight, even though we had boarding passes. They said we were not allowed to fly on a plane without our bags and that they were unable to get our bags onto that flight due to the delay to our previous flight. We were told no later flights were available to the airport we had booked but that we would be booked onto a flight 2 hours later to a different Buenos Aires airport. This was so that we could supposedly fly with our bags, as per their policy. We were given new boarding cards, with seats in the 6th row and asked to wait. When we went to board the later plane we realised it was a much smaller and older plane than the one we had booked. It had no entertainment and was dirty. Then the icing on the cake was when we went to board they told us we couldn’t sit in our assigned seats and had been moved to the back of the plane because our seats had been given to someone else. When we eventually landed, you can imagine how horrified we were that after the sequence of LATAM failures that we had already endured, our bags did not arrive. We had been lied to about why we couldn’t board our original connection and why we had to fly to another airport and endure further delays. We queued at the baggage counter for a further hour trying to report our missing bags. We were told that the bags were still in Santiago but that there was no way of knowing when they would arrive in Buenos Aires. We were instructed to wait in our apartment at all times in case our bags arrived as no time or day could be given. We waited 3 days (it was a 4 night break to BA) before our bags arrived and our entire trip was wasted. More than one month later we have no resolution from LATAM. They now say that our issue was caused by “weather conditions” they don’t answer any of our questions when we write to them and they take 15-20 days each time they need to reply to a message.

Latam lounge in Santiago nice, with lots of space and some privacy as well, food surprisingly good (some high quality chirashi, for example), with a wide selection of wines and drinks. Onboard experience with Latam today is a mixed bag, it used to be a premium airline let's say 10 years ago but doesn't feel it any longer. This time our B777-300 was an old, really old TAM aircraft, interior had seen much better days and seats were worn out (on the brink of breaking down in some places, with some tape here and there). Seats were in a 2-2-2 configuration without direct aisle access for most passengers, therefore (unless you were in the central pair of seats) either you climb on your neighbour or you get climbed upon to gain aisle access; all in all narrow seat, not very comfortable. I read Latam will retrofit all long haul aircraft to a new business class cabin, I really hope this happens soon as today the feeling is all but premium. Boarding was sort of an ""all-in"" experience since, although priority was enforced, we had to wait some 20 minutes to actually get on the plane (everybody from one door), therefore once we boarded there was a general mess that prevented FAs to be somehow useful to premium passengers. Once in flight, service was just OK (crew not that much interested in providing anything more than what was needed), food bland and amenities almost non existent even in a 4 hours flight.

The food was bland and small servings. There didn't appear to be any of the usual between meals snack available on other airlines. We were an hour late leaving Melbourne and still an hour late arriving, that gave us 10 min to make our connection.

I waited more than 4 days for the bag to be delivered after it was actually left at GRU airport after it arrived in GRU after the next flight I was on with no action by the airline. There was no immediate compensation or assistance, told to mail their call center and I will receive USD 25 in my bank account within 2 weeks?

Breakfast a single slice of bread and a yogurt on a long haul flight? Cost cutting mixed with a consultant that never spoke to customers managing catering? 3) Crew and Call Center staff do not speak English, I can understand if there is only basic English but no English is a concern in a safety situation. 4) Delay on the return flight of 2.5 hours, delays happen which is fine but it is obvious that the JNB route is treated as a route that is left for a last resort maintenance aircraft, checking flight radar the flight was delayed on all days I could check. 5) My biggest issue! On my return trip I would miss my connection in JNB to CPT due to the delay, no issue as I would be rebooked on the next flight, my original connection was on Comair, I was then moved to SAA. When I asked for my boarding pass for my connecting flight I was told I would receive it in JNB. On arrival in JNB SAA said I had no booking at the check in counter, I was referred to ticketing.

Once in the plane they gave us a menu so as to choose the food we wanted to eat, but as if they were joking us, they later said that they did not have that food because they confused when loading it in the aircraft.

The flights themselves were fine, but when we arrived in LA we found that all our luggage was lost. Annoying, but relatively common. One of the items Latam lost was our carseat which was needed for us to drive home. Latam's response ""there's nothing we can do."" Giving out loaner car seats in this situation is common practice at every other major airline. Latam's ""solution"" was for me to drive around LA at 10pm to find an open store and purchase a new carseat (not sure what would've happened if my wife was traveling alone with our daughter?). All this added 4 hours to our travel time getting us home very late and with a very tired two-year-old. We were told by everyone we at Latam LAX that we would be reimbursed by Latam for the purchase price of the carseat we were forced to buy AND we would get all our property back. We received our luggage 4 days later, but no carseat (wrapped up with the carseat was a small, antique, wooden stool a family member gave our daughter which can not be replaced). We contacted Latam and they said it can't be found and that the case was closed because we were already reimbursed for the purchase price of the carseat we were forced to buy (the price of the carseat we lost was MUCH higher than the one we bought in a panic). We have still not been reimbursed for our lost property and are just repeatedly being told they can't do anything. Every step of this process has been horrible. From the staff at LAX to the call center staff to the email exchanges. Everyone has treated us like it is our fault they lost our property. I have repeatedly been told by the call center staff there is no supervisor or manager on duty (a blatant lie, there's no such thing as a call center with no supervisors).

The last 5 interactions with Latam Airlines have all been disappointing. They let me sit in the airplane on the tarmac for 1.5 hours, then had us return to wait in the terminal for another 2 hours. Then they cancelled the flight. I believe they knew the whole time there was a technical problem with the plane the whole time, but waited until we could not have rescheduled to one of the other 4 flights that left that night. I saw them pull the luggage loading ramp up to the plane to take the luggage off the plane 2 hours before they cancelled the flight. They then rescheduled for the next morning. As a result, I did not meet my friend in Lima who flew out the next morning - the main purpose for my flight. Lots of people then missed their connecting flight to the United States. A nightmare for the traveler and for us who are supporting their trip. Our visitor's flight from Lima to Pucallpa was cancelled due to ""fog"". They did not take off from Lima for another 3 hours. Today I went to pickup another group flying Latam. This flight came to Pucallpa, but did not land because of ""fog"", then flew back to Lima. What a waste of time It seems like they are flying VFR (Visual Flight Regulations). They probably will not come now until the regularly scheduled evening flight - another 12 hours. How can they not know the weather conditions? How can they fly a commercial plane that cannot land in what I would call ""mild"" fog? As a side note, the arrival monitor said that the flight had landed. It is a problem living in a culture where it is so easy to lie. Yesterday, another visitor who purchased her ticket with Latam 3+ months ago, checked in with Latam 3 hours before the flight and was told it was overbooked and would have to wait 12 hours before the next flight. Ridiculous ! We had her buy a ticket on Peruvian and come much sooner. Latam now has a policy for different fares for different amount of luggage. In the process of booking my flight, it seemed like they were extracting fees for what is normal on other airlines here in Peru. They said my carry-on was too large and charged me $25 dollars. My carry on is a regulation size and I have never had a problem with the other airlines in Peru carrying it on for the past 6 years. The bottom line: Visitors come for 6 or 7 days, and are wasting up to 2 days of their trip because Latam does not deliver their flights on time. I would choose Peruvian Airlines, Star Peru, or LC Peru. Note: Watch LC Peru's luggage limits if you are coming from the USA with 2 bags (LC flys smaller airplanes).

As there was no option to book business class tickets for LA to Lima part of the trip in the end we have purchased only Hong Kong to LA through Cathay Pacific and decided to use the LATAM website to purchase business class tickets for LA to Lima on the same day. Everything was great until the payment part on LATAM website. Once we have entered the Visa CC details and clicked on pay now we have instantly received message that payment is rejected and to try making the payment again with provided link. As we were surprised with the message we have tried to make payment using MasterCard which in the end was also rejected by the website (ticketing office). At this pint we were scared about what has happened and decided to contact LATAM customer service directly. The CS officer picked up the call relatively fast and we have given him the reservation code to which he mentioned that the reservation is visible in the system but that their website sometimes rejects payments for no apparent reason. After waiting awhile for him to check with his manager he has offered to put us through to phone payment option where we again imputed our credit card details to be put on hold for another 5-10 minutes. The CS officer got back to us saying that unfortunately they are not able to accept payment over the phone at this time and in case we would like to keep the reservation we would need to go to ONE WORLD partner ticketing office in Hong Kong and make payment by presenting reservation code in matter of several days. As everything was done on Saturday I drove for 2 hours to HK airport and Cathay Pacific (one world partner) ticketing office to make the payment. At the counter I was told that CP is not able to accept payments for any other OneWorld partner ticket reservations. At this moment we called LATAM Customer Service again and they have said they are sorry for giving us wrong information but if we try again through their website the payment would now be accepted. I have gone online to try purchasing the tickets again while on the phone with CS but the price has risen more than 100% at the time. As we had reservation pending for payment in worth of cca US$7500 they didn't want to offer us the same price but told us that we have to pay US$16000 as the price displayed on their website at present. After complaining to CS over the phone they have said that they are not able to help us with problem anymore and if we want to complain we can do so online. So not only we lost the acceptable price for Business Class tickets, money for 2 hours worth of international calls but we were also scared as our connecting flights might not match. At this moment we had to contact Cathay Pacific to help us purchase connecting flight economy class by cancelling HK-LA tickets and reissuing HK-Lima tickets. It was the worst CS handling of a problem caused by either really lousy website or poor security center team for their payments as payment went through 3d authentication.

A very disappointing experience this time around, not that I was expecting other the top service but it was below average. To start off, the Check-In was slow as the Ground Team was more worried about having a briefing then prioritising the passengers. I wasn't given a fast track pass through security as they had none even when they seem to be organised. Upon boarding, again there was no priority for High Tiered and Premium passengers and main reason being it was a bus gate. The Crew onboard were very mediocre, absolutely no one stood out even with their extra touches. Pre-departure drinks took a long time to get around with a very basic amenity kit given straight after. The catering was okay nothing amazing with selections or taste. At least the IFE was decent, plenty of options though I couldn't compare it with Emirates offering.

At the check-in for passengers with Status Loyalty / Lanpass simply in Guarulhos there is no one, three employees chatting at check-in the lolzes understand the atmosphere of professionalism of the Company. Boarding via remote location. After takeoff the cabin crew disappears in the galleys and you can find them eating and talking.

Notice the total lack of interest on the part of the crew in ""selling"" the products offered and disappear quickly into the Galley. In a market where there have been months of increasing criticism of Latam and services equivalent to a ""low cost"", there is a change from a corporate client to better companies in the market such as Avianca, Azul and Gol (the latter improving every time more). And at the end of the trip, a questionnaire is received from the LATAM President Customers Relations with a questionnaire to be pre-filled; sign that the company is concerned.

Lan used to be a very good airline, but after the merger with Tam it went to hell big time. The list of ordeals that we have experienced with LATAM are endless. They include one time when they completely lost the record of my wife's Business Class flight from LA to Lima. If you have to make a change in your ticket forget it. You will just have to buy a whole new ticket. I have lost numerous tickets because of that. Sometimes their change fees exceed the cost of the original ticket. Their customer service is the worst ever. If you have a problem their standard answer is that will open a ""case."" Then you never hear from them again. One time my wife (who is Peruvian) asked why they had not responded to a ""case"" that they had opened. They said that they would open a case to see why the ""case had not been answered. If you go into a Lan office in Lima it is full of angry customers. One time my wife went into the office and bought a ticket. The agent booked it on the wrong day. Even there right in front of my wife she could not change it to the correct flight. She said that the computer would not allow her to do it. Another time we had a problem with one of my wife's purchased Business Class flights. We called Lan's Customer Service and were connected to one of their call centers in Columbia. The agent put us on ""hold"" except that he actually did not put us on hold. We could hear him laughing about my wife's problem in the background with some of the other agents. What kind of an airline is this?  Unfortunately Lan has a government arranged monopoly on some domestic Peruvian routes.

High quality duvet, pillow and seat encourages deep sleep. Food and wine was a high point and crew seem to take genuine pride in presenting Chilean fare and hospitality. Airlines and their crew should represent their culture and Latam was a great intro to Chile. Plane was full and crew to pax ratio was good, toilets always clean but tiny (that's the same in every Dreamliner).

When we were waiting for the flight to open, the information on screen changed to 'delayed', but no one cared to inform us. Only after an hour they called out the landing ground had been 'too wet' for the plane to land, and therefore we would have to wait for more information.  It took another 1,5 hours before we heard that our flight was truly cancelled, so even though it was already clear we wouldn't be flying at 11 pm, action was undertaken only around 2 am. We then had to wait for 1,5 hour for vans to drive us to hotels in Rio Branco. They had ordered only 3 and we were with way too many people. If they had ordered more at 11, the progress would have been quicker. In the meantime, almost nobody spoke English, and the staff kept reassuring us that the vans would arrive in 10 minutes (which would mean at least 40 minutes). The worst experience, however, was with the online customer service. I wanted to do an online check-in, but I needed a Brazilian CPF for that, which I don't have because I'm Dutch. It took me literally 4 hours to make them answer me and even then they responded very inadequately, slowly, they misread my questions on purpose to give the wrong answers and they made me pay double for check-in at the airport because their website is not functioning properly. I'm still waiting for them to compensate the made expenses, but so far I'm not expecting anything anymore. Sidenote: their planes are not comfortable if you're taller than 1,60m and don't expect to be served any food or water.

The staff were generally good - even though check-in is often confusing, staff were helpful and very fast. Some flights were on A320s - old fit out and no seat-back screens (you can stream entertainment from their app but there are no power points so battery life is an issue). The others were on 787s - much newer and roomier but with some strange design like the seat cushions moving around and having an uncomfortable gap at the back and the seat-back screens being fixed, so if the person in front reclines their seat, you have to watch at an angle. Short flights get just a drink, medium flights get snack food and the flights to Easter Island had full meals but they weren’t very good. Generally there’s no alcohol available (which must be a regional thing as I noticed it on Aerolineas as well) but strangely there was alcohol on the flight from Easter Island (but not the flight to Easter Island). Several flights used remote stands and buses, which is always horrible, but I didn’t think LATAM managed them very well, like holding up buses for staff.

My group was totally hustled / ripped off in Mexico City. After flying into Mexico City from Los Angeles on Alaska Airlines, and waiting in a line of literally 1000+ people in customs (just for an international connection to Sao Paulo, Brazil) we arrived at the ticket counter about an hour before the flight, waited in line for about 15 minutes, got to the ticketing agent, and were told that it was ""impossible"" for us to board our scheduled flight, because LATAM flights close 1 hour before flight time (who does this?). We were then told that the next flight would be 24 hours later, and that there was nothing they could do, other than charge us each another $270 for a ""transfer fee"" to get us on the flight the following day. We were there in time, in line, there were at least 4 employees at their computers and only 1 agent actually helping a customer at a time. They then referred us to the Hilton hotel in the airport, where we had to pay an additional $288 for a room that we were forced to get since they did not allow us our boarding passes, where we could have been at the boarding gate with a good 40-45 minutes to spare before wheels up. When boarding the flight the next day, I spoke with 2 boarding agents at the gate, and they said they close the flight routinely about 25-30 minutes before flight time. Thus, we would have easily made our original flight. After posting our dilemma on Facebook, I learned from several people that LATAM has a HISTORY of doing this to others. And after reading reviews from several different sites, it seems to be very true. This appears to be some sort of racket, and I want to know how LATAM is willing to compensate for the additional almost $400USD that I was forced to spend due to deception and flat out lies we were told.  In addition, in the other legs of my trip flying on LATAM, we would be told to go to a certain gate, Gate 4 for example. There would be all the passengers sitting in front of gate 4 waiting for boarding agents to arrive. Not too long before the flight was supposed to leave, there was still no LATAM employees there at the gate we were told to be at. After checking the flight monitors again, we would discover that the gate number had been changed to Gate 17. There was no announcement by LATAM regarding the gate change, no LATAM employees at the original gate to let us know that the gate had changed, and thus there were dozens of passengers running through the airport trying to get to the new gate and not miss the flight. What the hell is going on over there? This happened twice in our return trip; once in Montevideo, Uruguay, and again in Santiago, Chile. I hope that LATAM understands the severity of this negligence, and is willing to make up for it.

On the B773 usually the outer rows of seats have 2 floor mounts, which are intelligently placed between the three seats, and therefore don't disturb leg space. On the LATAM B773 there are three floor mounts, which are positioned exactly were your legs want to be and therefore reduce the legs a lot. If that isn't enough, LATAM installed a footrest on every seat (which is literally a net that lays on the floor) so the leg space is reduced even more!

Due to next day arrival in London my booked rental car was no longer available and I was faced with upgrade costs as it was now Christmas Eve. LATAM have refused to pay any compensation because their staff in Sao Paulo put as a reason for missing the original London Flight as a delay in the connecting flight (3rd Lie). I have followed their complaints procedures and made suggestions to settle the claim to no avail. As a regular traveller between Brazil and London they were presented options for future flights to settle my grievances amicably but to no avail. It appears that talking to the other passengers that had their tickets cancelled they all tell the same story. It is clear that LATAM use this form of fabrication of the truth to avoid paying out compensation for their continuing policy of overbooking flights.

Then, we could not choose our seats, so I was in row 1 and my friend in row 19. They did not give us any newspaper to read and no food, not even peanuts, pretzels or a glass of water. The ""entertainment online"" offered assumes you have a smart device with you (with enough space and batteries) and it also assumes that you had previously downloaded their app at the gate (do they have Wi-Fi there? , did somebody told you this before entering the plane?). So, it was one of the most boring trips! Fortunately, it was a 1.5 hour trip, but taking into account the initial plane's delay and the fact that you have to be two hours in advance at the airport, we ended up our trip starving. On the return flight, my friend and I got stocked-up with drinks, food, candy, magazines, and so on. The trip was quite expensive even! Definitely, no comparison between the high price of the plane ticket and the very poor service received. I can't imagine a longer trip with this airline.",0,0,0,Not specified,LATAM Airlines

543051,2018-01-14,Ingo Reisch,True,Family Leisure,Business Class,Santiago to Melbourne,January 2018,4,5,5,4,yes,the crew were quite amazing,"Overall a great experience on this newly established direct flight from Santiago to Melbourne with Latam's new fleet of Dreamliners. For this long stretch Latam opts for the 900 Series providing the capacity for a 13.5-15 hr flight spending on direction of winds. Check-in in Santiago was super easy. The exclusive business check-in area is situated at level 3 of the airport, which is also where the VIP lounge is located. It took all of 5 minutes to check-in and go through the VIP passport and security control leading you directly into a very large lounge spread over 2 floors. Boarding commenced approx. 45 minutes before departure and doors were closed near enough at our scheduled departure time. To our surprise the scheduled 15 hour flight was reduced to 13.2 hrs. For me the layout of the 800 Series is nicer, but again no issue with the 900 Series. In-flight staff during the entire 13+ hr flight was non stop just looking after us, truly the busiest crew I have seen for a long time. We got dished out a lunch, a snack and a dinner approx. 2 hours before arrival. The food standards are OK, but not to compare to Singapore or Emirates. Even though an espresso pod machine should have been available, it was somehow out of action, which was disappointing. The South American wines are worth trying. Reds from Chile are amazing. Headphones are not the best in the air, with little or no noise cancellation benefits. No PJ's provided and the small amenity kit is also just OK, a trend with most airlines and why not as most of it ends up in the bin. On our flight no newspaper or magazine was available in English, a bit of a shame. The crew forgot to hand out migration forms and after asking 1 hr before landing I was told they had none on board. Minutes later they hastily started handing them out, however the crew wasn't familiar with the Australian requirements for each person to have a in-coming migration/customs form completed (both sides). Families were told only one per person was required. Further, business class passengers did not receive an Express card, which allows you to fast track passport and customs check-points. To add to this you can't use smart gates, as you must answer a question where you spend most time at and most South American countries prevent you to enter via the smart gates. Even though luggage was priority tagged our 4 cases had the pleasure to arrive right at the end. Back to the inflight experience, I mentioned to the purser that the right hand front toilet randomly would flush (also when you are sitting on it, which is a rather strange experience) and that the left hand lavatory had a faulty water tap, which was running non stop. After such a long day in the sky the purser wasn't really interested and told me the water tap issue is linked to the aircrafts hydraulics and it always happens at the start (2 hrs into the flight?) and yes the other toilet had a sensitive switch (clearly very sensitive as I never even touched it and it happened a few times). Aircraft Reg: CC-BGF in case Latam wants to get these items fixed. Overall the flight was great with amazing glimpses of the Antarctica, the crew were quite amazing and we arrived well in Melbourne without having to stop-over in Auckland NZ and sit there for 6 hours, so thank you Latam.",3,4,0,Boeing 787-900,LATAM Airlines

Our first flight on Latam’s fleet of Boeing 787 and in fact our first flight on Latam in a wide bodied aircraft. We arrived at the business check-in counter and the usual annoying thing happened as ground staff wanted to redirect us to the economy section. Such a simple thing to manage by simply saying please come through into our business class area. Check-in was quick as expected. There is no Latam or partner lounge in Lima and we received 3 x US$ vouchers for 3 different food places within the terminal. We did run out of time, so never used them. Boarding the Boeing 787  is very exciting as the ceiling height is massive. Latam operates 2+2+2 configuration with ample space to reach your seat even it is the window seat. Whilst a short flight, the service was spot on. The purser introduced herself and overall inflight staff was in a pleasant way managing the cabin. Shortly after take off we were offered a decent breakfast and after having cleared away the trays, the crew arranged for a comfy duvet and large pillow. Windows got electronically dimmed. The choice of in-flight entertainment was excellent along with the screen size, whilst quite away from you.

When I asked if I was going to receive that too, they said no because my flight was leaving in an hour, which was a lie because it ended up leaving 3 hours after the original one. The new flight was taking me to a different airport which was 45 km (27 miles) away from the original one. That was a major inconvenience for me. They told me they would take care of my baggage internally with the other company. When I arrived to Buenos Aires my luggage never appeared. I spoke with people from both companies but no one knew anything. I demanded to speak with a supervisor, who made a call and found out that my luggage was in Aeroparque, the original Airport which I was supposed to arrive to.

After booking the flight and a happy check in at Cusco airport, a staff informed us about the fact that we booked a Peruvian fare ticket. I explained her the fact that we already knew. She showed us the Spanish webiste of Latam which is different from the English version. There it said that tourist can only buy the highest rate. This is not clear on the English website, besides that, the English website asks a few times for you nationality and passport number, so it could also have warned us. Which would be more customer friendly. After lengthy discussions, where staff even indicated that we are stupid and made a mistake, that was not a pleasant experience. We were able to not pay the fine of USD 177 (insane amount!) but the difference between the fares. She did not show us the calculation we just had to pay USD 121 in total.

No information was announced using a microphone or by an employee, to direct passengers. The news we had, was from the information desk and from other passengers. Finally they told us, the flight was canceled. They offered a snack ticket to passengers. This ticket was for a spoiled salad. I and my sister didn't eat it. Information was very mismatched. We had to cancel our check in, return to immigration and pick up our luggage. The airport staff were angry and treated us poorly. At night we went to a hotel. But we had to wait for the driver who would take us to Ezeiza airport at 00:30 a.m. In the Ezeiza airport we had to do the check in again. On both flights, JJ8008 when we went form Guarulhos to Buenos Aires and the back JJ9604, replacing the JJ8009, we were served bread that was clearly stale.

LATAM sales then demanded we purchase a full fare return ticket, even though we showed the Sales Agent we had a valid return ticket. We had flown to South America for a once in a lifetime visit to Galapogos. We had no choice but to pay a hugely inflated price for a ticket we had already purchased. We were told by LATAM sales management in Quito we should be refunded our improperly sold ticket. On check-in at Quito, the check-in Manager used our originally purchased tickets for the flight.

The LATAM connection line from T3 Int’l to T2 domestic had more than 300 people queuing, all coming from different morning flights, but there was no priority check in for business class passengers or OneWorld emerald members. The priority was for physically disadvantaged only. The ground staff was unhelpful. Passengers choked at this point but the staff was unable to advice or redirect us. In fact people can go to T2 for a short walk upstairs to check in there too instead of waiting at these connection desks between T3&T2 for 3 hours. Encountered similar situations for the next 3 more domestic flights again. The LATAM check in priority lanes for OneWorld elite members had no English signage and accepted all passengers. The check in at CGH domestic took more than an hour. The “preferential” boarding lanes were there but often not in use.

After I passed security and passport control, I went  to the Qantas Business Lounge for breakfast. Flight did not depart until 11:10 am but we boarded 1 hour prior to departure. Once onboard, the service was incomparable to any Business Class service I've had to date. Crew were friendly and engaging. They offered to take pictures for me and I was the only passenger to be offered champagne. The 787-9 Business Cabin was spacious with plenty of room to move around, though I prefer a 1-2-1 layout, I think the 2-2-2 form was adequate for short journeys. The food offered was above average and though I prefer a menu, I can understand that it was only a 2.5 hour flight and having one was not necessary.

Seats in economy were 31"" pitch- tight for an 11 hour flight. Plane was clean and seat and entertainment systems all worked well. Once we took off, in early afternoon, full meal was served with good Chilean red wine. Flight attendants were helpful, efficient and available.

Service in Miami was pleasant but not as good as it should be. Most spoke Portuguese quite well but English was limited in some of the personnel. LATAM had modified my flights but had failed to correct my entire reservation. Took me over 20 minutes of one on one with personnel to get it straight.

Over the past 9 years my I have flown with Lan airlines more that 16 times around South America and from Australia to South America. This, however was our first trip with them as LATAM. Never again! Lan and Tam as separate companies were always amazing once you got on the flight. The service outside of that, was never that good. However, now it is impossible to deal with them. Also, the standard of the inflight service has dropped dramatically. Both airlines used to be something i would recommend and boast about to friends coming to visit me in South America. I will just list the problems we had with a return flight from Melbourne to Buenos Aires and then a return flight from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo. The wrong flight departure times given for first leg of the flight (out buy 4 hours), tried to call customer service with wait times of over 45 minutes and then it would just disconnect. Called with a 2 hour wait time and the person on the other end giving the incorrect information. With language skills not proficient in Portuguese or English. Lost Luggage on two flights  The seat we reserved 9 months in advanced was not valid as I have an Australian passport and can not be verified until i arrive for that flight. The check-in managers response was ""we have this problem with every flight to Auckland and Sydney. We get so many complaints. The company have no interest in fixing this problem"" Flight delayed for over an hour without updating anyone. When I asked if they could just make an announcement so all the people waiting knew what was happening they just looked at me as if I had asked them to fly me on their back to my destination. On a leg of the flight that was over 3 hours the only food was a sandwich labelled ""vegi"" with cream cheese and some unidentified vegetable (only an assumption that it was a vegetable). When asked for the sandwich we could see other people opposite us eating we were told we are sitting on the other side of the plan so we can't have that one. Took 4 weeks to process the purchase of a ticket with lanpass points, we sent an email saying because they had changed out departure time we could change are return time/date with no additional cost. tried processing online and was directed to call. Tried calling gave up after 1 hour. Went into a Latam office and was told the only way it can be processed is if we call Latam and directed us to the phone. Was then told after waiting only 40 minuets for someone to answer that we could we just need to pay a small fee. However, the person calculated it incorrectly so after 1 hour of talking and clarifying he realised he didn't know what he was doing and we couldn't change our ticket. Positives The wine is good I will NEVER fly with them again. I will use Aerolineas Argentinas before them and that is saying something.  I believe now Latan feel like they can dominate the region and no longer have to impress their customers. Its such a shame. I was very much looking forward to this partnership but am so disappointed now.

Food is mediocre and after a few flight you see that it's a little repetitive. We sat towards the front on the 787 which was quiet. I'd avoid sitting in the centre near the toilets or in the rear - noisy due to toilets flushing or galley. Checkin at AEP was slow. Had tried to checkin online but their system is nonsensical. The checkin agent was fantastic and we ended up in the front row on both flights. Note that the first 4 rows of Y are space+ and have 2 inches more legroom.

Worst flying experience I've had, and it was on my honeymoon, sadly enough. Our flight was to leave at 4 am. We boarded the plane and waited in our seats for over an hour - no communication as to why there was a delay on take off. After an hour and a half of waiting we were told the flight had been cancelled because the plane was having engine troubles. They told us they didn't know when it would be rescheduled for, so we just had to wait. Then, 4 hours later, we found out the flight was rescheduled (to 12 hours after it was supposed to take off.) I talked to multiple people who said LATAM wouldn't let them switch to one of the earlier flights going to the same destination, even though there were seats available, so they missed their connections. When checking in for the rescheduled flight- there was 1 employee working doing check-in and bag drop, while 50 people waited in line. (and “conveniently"" the electronic check-in wasn't working that day either.) At one point, nobody was at the front desk for over 20 minutes, while the line continued to get longer. We were given ""vouchers"" since the flight was cancelled, which equalled 7,000 pesos or about $10 USD only to be used on a sandwich or NA beverage, and of course they were out of sandwiches and could only be used at the cafes outside of the gate area, so everyone had to go through security again just to get their ""free"" coffee. Wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't the cherry on top of a very long day. It was the slowest, most unorganized airport I have ever seen. I was told to expect an email with information about a $50 reimbursement. It's been almost a week and haven't received that email yet. Furthermore, $50 is not even close to enough considering we lost an entire day of our honeymoon because of this flight. Fortunately these things happen rarely.

I was told by the arrogant senior steward that the ground staff would help. Arriving at the terminal there was nobody from the airline to help with international connection, as suggested; the available staff did not speak English and was only guiding domestic connecting passengers. To make it worse the airport was poorly signed. The only people who really helped me were the duty free ladies. I had to run to terminal 3 and just made the flight. I tried to complained at the gate to the supervisor but she did not speak any English and did not bother apologising. On board, feeling tired and distressed I asked for a cup of water and was served by a very arrogant and unhelpful stewardess.

No smile, no explanations. Therefore you should expect shorter lines for dropping. Lines are huge, because they already closed many check-in stations. It took me more than 45mn to drop a single luggage. They also decided that Rimowa and Louis Vuitton bags should be dropped in a special place as they are ""very expensive items in case of damage"". The whole process was crazy. A321 is a high density aircraft now, with small pitch. I paid R$30,00 for emergency exit, with a lot of space.

The LATAM lounge in Sao Paulo is exceptional for food, drink, showers, space and comfort, and better than many other airlines.

I asked a crew member if they could ask the passenger to raise his seat a little and was met with a smile and a no.

I was furious at having spent $200USD for no reason but the stupidity doesn’t end there. 3 days later, 100% of the taxes (equivalent to about $5) for the cancelled flight were returned to my credit card, so I wrote to ask why.

I am skeptical of Sky’s allowable dimensions, and also of the inability of the check-in agent to apply credit for what I had already paid toward my new checked luggage fee. Sky ticket prices are good value but, like many budget airlines, you can’t know what you will pay ultimately due to odd baggage rules inconsistently applied.

We failed to convince the person at the counter, who finally charged our friends US$35 for each hand luggage. In the meantime they told us to board while they were paying, but we stayed to wait for them. But the worst comes later. The person at the counter, angry because we claim to try to help our friends and recorded the situation, told us that now we also have to pay US$35 for hand luggage, US$70 in total. At that time we showed her again our ID and black cards from the bank of Chile and we explained that we had already passed a while ago, but there was no case. She told us that we should have gone to the check in counter to qualify for the benefit. I have flown about 20 times with Sky Airlines in recent years using the benefit of the Bank of Chile and had never had a problem with my hand luggage using the benefit, having almost never gone through the check in counter. Moreover, one of the main reasons to choose Sky vs Other airlines is for this benefit. Additionally, I mentioned that we tried unsuccessfully to go through the preferred counter to try to change my seat for emergency exit and pass the baggage but there was a huge line of about 30 people and a single counter attending, which made it absolutely unfeasible and we would miss the flight waiting more than an hour at the preferred customers line. After a long discussion with the person at the boarding counter and about closing the door of the plane, they called the supervisor to try to fix the situation. But the supervisor was inflexible, she understood nothing about the situation and told us that if we didn't pay the US$70, the plane would let us down. Even after a couple of payment attempts, the payment machine did not work for them. Even so, she did not want to make the exception, while the gate was already closed. Finally, and with tremendous discomfort, we ended up paying the US$70 to board, while large numbers of passengers, without even being clients of the bank, passed their luggage without paying and without anyone telling them anything. After this I asked the supervisor for her name in order to write a claim. But she didn't want to give me her name, saying that if I insist, she would let me down the flight.

My food was a small sandwich and a soda, normal plane food. Once we arrived at the airport, we had to wait over an hour to receive our bags.

We were welcomed aboard their aircraft with a candy which was nice. Departure and arrival always on time or ahead of schedule with no problems regarding baggage which was always delivered promptly. The flight attendants could have been more smiley except for one who stood out providing a very warm service. However they were no grumpier than on other airlines.

Check-in was smooth and efficient and the booked seats (on the left of the plane to see the Andes chain) were delivered. But after that things unravelled. The incoming plane from Concepcion was 1.5 hours late; the weather at Concepcion was blamed. But LanChile had no problems! No announcements were made; all enquiries had to be requested individually from the occasional ground staff at the gate. Take-off was 2 hours late. No apologies; just a take it or leave it approach. The all-Economy cabin is very cramped. Meal service was poor. Only an inedible pasta; the chicken option had all gone by the time the troley had reached me in Row 7.

We tried to check into our flight online using their website, but it wouldn't let us. So we decided we would check in at the airport. When we got to the airport we waited in the check-in line for 40 minutes. There was only one employee working the check-in line, and they were taking super long to help people. They also kept disappearing for 10 minutes after helping someone. Meanwhile there were about 5 employees just standing around, not doing anything. They were directing people to wait in line, and talking to themselves. It was a stupid use of resources. A lot of people in line were complaining. When it was finally our turn, the employee told us casually that our flight was cancelled and we can take the next flight in 8 hours. We did not receive any text, email, or call about our cancellation. If we knew the flight was cancelled we would not have shown up to the airport so early. We ended up spending around 12 hours at the airport for no reason. Once we got to the gate for our flight, it kept getting delayed because the plane still had not arrived. It was so frustrating. It took forever for us to get boarded. Unfortunately we also had booked with Volaris for another flight from Oaxaca to Merida. And of course the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 mins, but they didn't mention anything about the flight being delayed. So again we showed up to the airport earlier than needed. It's very frustrating but we didn't say anything because we were not in a rush. When we started boarding the stupidest possible thing occurred. At the very last second as we were boarding, the employee told us we need to weigh our bags. I do not know why they waited until we were at the front of the line, as we are boarding, to make us weigh our bags, when the flight was already delayed by so long. After we weighed our bags they told us we need to move some 10kg from one bag to a different bag, or pay $750 pesos. They really wanted us to sit there and try to move 10kg from one bag to another. That is completely ridiculous. The bags are normal travel size and fit perfectly. We argued with the employee but they wouldn't budge. They held up the entire line and pressured us so that we had to pay the stupid fee. It was so unnecessary because both the bags were going onto the carry on spot anyways. They just charged us a fee and scammed us. It literally made no difference because we still boarded with the same bags and same weight in the bags. This airline is horrible. Do not book with this airline if you do not have to. They delay flights consistently.

It already started off bad when the lady at the counter said that my sister wouldn’t be able to receive her ticket because we simply didn’t put her second last name. Though that lady was really understanding, it was when the time to get on the plane that angered me and people around me. They had switched the plane number stations last minute without telling anyone. The counter people were rushing us and hurrying us and even end up yelling at me and my sister pushing us to the side separating me and my grandmother which is what i was trying to avoid as she cannot read or write. I had tried asking for help as it was the first time flying and without my parents to help guide us. Counter lady was yelling at everyone but didn’t want to help because she wanted everyone on the plane at a certain time even though they started check ins very late. We then encountered the same issue again about my sisters ticket not having her second last name and when i tried explaining to the lady that the people downstairs said it was fine she kept interrupting me asking for my last name. I was visibly frustrated as i was already separated from my grandmother. As i was able to meet up with my grandmother a lady behind me was complaining about the same thing about being rushed. We both talked about it as it was frustrating because many of these people are boarding with grandparents and are doing double the work with their own ticket and their grandparents ticket.

When we were finally seen, the employee accused us of missing our flight and when we explained that it is was not our fault he told us the only available flight was the following day at 9:30am and that we would have to pay for an additional Covid-19 test before he could provide us with the boarding passes. I won't even get into how terrible the process was to get the test done. After, we returned to the check in desk for our boarding passes and had to wait 40 minutes before being seen again. A different employee helped us this second time and again insisted it was our fault that our flight was missed, this person barely spoke English and had to translate through text (which was fine, as long as we got through) however, he kept walking away from the desk to ask a coworker questions and obviously was having trouble getting our flight figured out. Once he was finally able to do so we were told that we would not be able to check our luggage in until the following morning, mind you this at 7pm. So in addition to having to wait 14 hours for our flight home we were not permitted into the departure area we had to wait in the airport entrance in a Burger King lobby until the following morning. We got up early to make sure we were ahead of the line and even the at 3am the Volaris check in was packed of people and it still took us an hour to get checked in. Overall very disappointed in the service of this airline and will not be recommending or using it in the future. In fact we will very likely be discouraging others from booking with this airline.",1,1,1,Not specified,Volaris

Our family had to wait one hour and a half in line just to check our bags (we were in the customer with special needs because we had a baby and we were unable to print our boarding passes at the kiosk). I understand the special needs line can take longer for obvious reasons; however, they only had two counters helping customers and at some points they only had one (because the personnel was in and out). It seems like Volaris staff don't care about the time people stand in line; they seem apathetic, and also understaffed. Once we got to the counter, the lady was helpful, but at first I thought she might send us back to the end of the line because we didn't have our boarding passes. Luckily that didn't happen because I told her we already had been in line for an hour and a half and we were going to miss our flight if we did that. Once we got passed the check-in counter and onto security, that was another ordeal. The person checking the boarding passes said the stroller had to go through a different line. It was so confusing and frustrating because then another lady told us only one person can go through the stroller line and that the rest of the family had to go through the regular line. I didn't know what to do, and then the lady said ""or you can all try going through the same line but you will be sent back"". She was completely rude when she said that. We decided to take the risk of being sent back, and then we saw an entire family walk past us with a stroller and a baby and they were not sent back! Once we go passed security everything was fine. Additionally, I don't like how Volaris charges for everything, even for carry-on bags when other airlines don't do that. The checked-in bags were $80/each which is way too high compared to other airlines that charge $45-65.",1,0,0,Not specified,Volaris

I even paid to upgrade my seats to the front of the plane and was excited to get a decent deal during a holiday. Upon my initial check in at the airport, the problems began. Volaris told me I had two sets of tickets, which I was unaware of (as I only received one email with one receipt!) I told them I only wanted one flight and the assistant said she would take care of it. She apparently did and we boarded the plane and vacationed. Upon our attempt to return, we were told there was no flight for us, as our tickets had been cancelled! Upon further review, it was found by a Volaris agent, that the prior assistant had cancelled the flight I had the paperwork on, and had left the other flight open. The issue is, the return flight was on different date that was a week prior to our scheduled return date, and which we knew nothing about! The agents in Guadalajara would not budge and since we have responsibilities, we had to get home and had to buy a subsequent return ticket. The agent assured us that the other ticket for a ""missed flight"" would be refunded by contacting customer service after we returned. Volaris customer service is basically non-existent and not of service. You can never get a live person on a phone line, unless you're buying a ticket. I used the email link, to which Volaris states will be responded to ""within 2 days"" - I've written three emails, each a week apart--and I have had no response! I sent a Messenger message and have gotten no response except an animated, antiquated number system sending me in a loop. I finally got a horrible response on Whatsapp that told me it was too late to request a refund, since I had ""accepted"" the initial flight and had ""missed"" the return flight. I should state here, that the return flight we repaid for, was not full, either! So here I sit with Volaris claiming there's nothing they can do---for their mistakes, which as cost me twice what I was originally paying! Thus, my flight has ended up costing me far more than any other airline would've in the first place. It's a scam! Volaris doesn't have low fares.

Volaris recommended that we arrive 2 hours early. We arrived 3 hours early. We had bags to check and after going through security and immigration we still had an hour and a half before we flew. We got in line to check our bags. Volaris had very few people checking bags. The ones that were working were moving extremely slowly with no regard for people missing their flight. As the line progressed very slowly we became concerned that we were going to miss our flight. I voiced my concerns in Spanish to the girl working for Volaris twice and she just said to be patient as she allowed several passengers to go in front of us. Finally when we were allowed to go to the check in, the attendant said the baggage check was closed for our flight and we would have to carry on our luggage/fishing gear. We went to check in our carryon luggage and the Volaris security girl opened our bags and started removing items that she said couldn’t be carried on. She called over another employee and removed the following items from my carryon bag, fishing lures, all hooks, all sinkers, pliers and all three of my expensive fishing reels. She allowed a very sharp fillet knife to stay in the bag with no problem. She put these items in a tray and was going to keep them. By this time our gate was closed and we were going to miss our flight. I grabbed my stuff for her and out it back in my bag. We ended up getting a taxi in Mexico, bringing all of our luggage back through US customs and over the border and taking another taxi to the parking lot. I ended up driving the 700 miles into Mexico to Loreto as a result of their complete and utter disregard for their passenger’s welfare. Volaris is beyond incompetent. We spoke to other fishermen in Loreto that had the same experience with Volaris. They had very expensive fishing tackle seized and confiscated by Volaris employees or missed their flights like us. Every fisherman that we spoke to about Volaris said they would never fly with them again. One couple said they saw a wedding party leaving Tijuana who had all missed their flight and the wedding because of Volaris horrible service. After arriving in Loreto I tried to cancel my return flight for credit. They wouldn’t’ even give credit for the canceled flight.

The customer service was the worst I've ever experienced in my life. Your client services and boarding agents where just plain rude and the most condescending people I've encountered. After we checked in presented our passports, had them scanned, and obtained boarding passes we where asked if we would check in my husband's 1 carry on suit case for free since there was alot of baggage on board. We didn't have any reason not to so we kindly agreed and proceeded to the security check point where we where asked for our passports and boarding passes. We quickly realized that my husband put his passport in the carry on we checked in, and we asked if we should go try to retrieve it as we had 2.5 hours before our flight time and we had just checked in. The security check point officer assured us my husband could board with his boarding pass and any identification (he had a California ID and Us Resident ID card) we where told that would be fine. We waited till they called our group to board at the gate and that's when 4 different volaris boarding agents where rude and unwilling to listen to what happened or try to accommodate us. We told them the passport was scanned when we got the boarding passes and then put away in the carry on which was documented with the paid luggage. They said we'd have to go to customer service and reschedule our flight because no one could board without a passport in hand (my husband even had a picture of his passport on his cell phone they didn't care to even look at it) . We pleaded for someone to request our luggage since we still had 1 hour before take off but they told us luggage couldn't come back to the airport until after the plane took off. We asked for a supervisor and the rude lady checking document's to board said she was the supervisor of that flight and there was no one above her. We ended up having to reschedule our flight, pay $240.00 USD for that, have new covid test done which ran us $100USD more, find a place to stay for the next 2 days because they didn't have any flight for 2 more days and my husband missed 2 days of work. In the end it was a very stressful and expensive experience leaving us with no desire to ever fly with your airline or any other Mexican airline ever! It's upsetting that your company allows this type of behavior from your employees we are your customers after all and who keep your company afloat.

Once we arrived to the airport we explained our situation of not being allowed to check in through our phones to the front desk people of Volaris. They made up some lame excuse saying that it had to do with a credit card having money on hold. It quickly got resolved. Next they said it costs $70 each for a checked bag since we waited to pay at the airport. We explained again about not having access to check in through our phones and they did not care. I asked if we can take carry on bags up on the plane with us and they said “yes with an extra cost.” I asked if it will be cheaper than the checked bag cost and they said “yes.” So we paid $70 for each checked bag and paid for 2 carry ons. I look at my credit card to see that they charged my card and it said $149 for 2 carry ons. In total we paid about $400 for 2 carry ons and 3 checked bags.

Layover was supposed to be 1 hr 40 mins. But the flight from Cancun was delayed by an hour. Kept checking with the flight attendants on the delay and I had to catch a connecting flight. They kept saying the airline already knows about the delay and not to worry. But by the time we got out the flight there was 30 mins left to get to the other gate. The walk to the other gate was like 20 mins and the flight gate was closed and I had to reschedule my flight. Nobody even speaks English to understand I was flying with two kids and a pregnant wife. If only they coordinated and held the flight for another few mins my family would have got on. After that it took me two hours to reschedule the flight.

They never told me I had options to select to Oakland, SFO or other nearby airports. Lucky for us we checked and got on a flight to Oakland the same day. Its minimum common sense to have at least one person who can communicate in for any airline and its minimum common sense to delay your connecting flight when your own airline is delayed at the other airport. If there is no communication whatsoever its perfectly shitty airlines to travel in. All airports in mexico are so commercial. There are no water fountains at all at the airports, but they made sure to have so many stores to make money. The gates are placed far away from each other cos they spent money to build stores in between each gate and not focusing on passenger satisfaction. Very poorly organized airport.

Fine I downloaded the app and was having questions to what they responded with, “we have no knowledge of the website. We can only help you if you check in.” That translated to, pay up for help.

Staff is polite, but everything about this airline screams cheap.  I always print my own boarding pass if I can, but the fact that they charge a service fee for this blows my mind. Even a soft drink on board has a charge. If you need to check a bag and you want to reserve a seat, you aren't really saving any money by the time you pay extra for everything. Might as well pay 5-10 bucks more and get a little leg room. The gate area in LAX was inadequate. They require you to be at the gate about 45 minutes early, but there are barely enough seats in the gate area for 25% of the booked passengers. The day I flew many of the passengers were elderly. No wonder so many of the pax requested wheelchairs. It's that or stand for 45 minutes or more. Foolishly, I made a 2nd reservation to fly to MIA in April, before I had taken my first trip with them. The schedule I booked was a X'n through MEX that was reasonable. They have since changed their schedule, and the only alternatives require 10 hour layovers, all day in LAS followed by a red-eye flight to MIA, or overnight in ORD with a flight that gets me to MIA too late the following day.

We tried calling the new reservations line and of course a representative answered but then immediately hung up as soon as we mentioned we already had a booked flight. We went to the Volaris Airline counter at our local airport (SMF) and spoke to the station manager. She was rude and refused to identify her self (she covered her badge when I asked her to identify herself) or provide us with contact information for anyone that may be able to help us. Although my spouse and I were calm and not animated she called the Sheriffs working at the airport, who informed us that it was common for Volaris Airlines to call security to get rid of customers who were dissatisfied. They also obtained her name and indicated all airport employees are required to wear and display identification. My spouse and I are unable to change our flights as she is deploying July and has pre-deployment training in June. I work as a nurse at David Grant Medical Center and am considered essential personnel and have been denied leave until further notice.

We had a good experience on Volaris traveling from the LAX to Leon and back. The flight was direct. It has the shortest duration and best departure time so was great for the family. And the price was reasonable. It had assigned seating. Just to state the obvious this is a budget Mexican airline. So, I would not come in with the expectation like having wi-fi, super comfortable seats, cabin staff speaking perfect English. But if you view this as a Mexican version of Southwest then you should be okay. Few things I learned about this airline from this trip: 1. Only buy the ticket from the Volaris website. They code share with Frontier so I thought I could just buy the tickets from a generic ticket purchasing website. I ran into trouble (e.g. couldn't select the seats, couldn't get the return flight booked). But then bought the exact same flight from Volaris website with no issues. 2. They actually have reasonably priced food and drink on the flight and accept credit cards. But on the return flight only accepted pesos for some reason. If you really want something to drink besides water bring some pesos. 3. You can print out your boarding passes before you get to the airport and save you some time. But I ran into a glitch where I had to wait until the middle of the night before the boarding pass completed. Maybe it was a load issue on the website. Now that I am familiar with this airline I will probably take it again.

I have flown with this airline 6 times and only 1 bad experience. My bad experience was my first time flying with them. I had purchased specific seats for the flight but because it wasn’t a booked flight they said they needed to even out the weight on the plane so the attendant at the gate moved our seats. I told him I had paid for these seats so he said he would put a note in the system and if I called the airlines customer service 800# they’d refund me my money I paid for the seats. I called customer service and basically the guy lied to me about the note. Whatever! - lesson learned don’t pay for specific seats just let the system choose them for you and you don’t have to pay. The on board airplane staff is always nice and courteous. They have sandwiches and snacks that are not overpriced on board. They will have people at the gate sometimes asking if you want to check in your carry-on free of charge because there’s no room in the overhead compartments. They have an app I use every time that is very convenient. You don’t need to print a boarding pass because the app has it on there, simply take a screenshot just in case your phone fails to load at the airport. Check in on the app before hand and purchase any add ons like luggage, extra weight to luggage or special seating ahead of time before you check in so they don’t charge you heavy fees for doing it at the airport. I learned how to work with them and for a low cost flight I don’t mind flying with them. The only terrible thing about them is their customer service at the 800#. I learned you don’t really get anywhere with them so don’t use their airline if your plans are susceptible to change. I suggest to do your homework, check in ahead of time and be at airport at least 2 hours early to be safe of any overbooked flights and so you can check in your Bags. Make sure your luggage doesn’t weigh over the limit. Check in using the app and save a screenshot of your confirmation # plus boarding passes. Overall my experiences with booking flights with this airline using the app and flying from the Tijuana airport to Guadalajara and back again haven't been terrible.

They charged me 25 dollars when I bought the ticket because I was not Mexican even though the extra charge was for non-residents which I am so I should not have paid it. When I went to call them they said that I should not contact them I should contact the tax people instead even though it was their fault. Absolutely awful customer service.

No reason or explanation was given but I suspect the airline had undersold the flight so consolidated two flights. To really add insult to injury the problem I have then had was getting a simple refund of the ticket. The airline never responds to email and I have had to call customer service each time. With each phone call they have requested a different thing. So first I had to provide my bank details, then they wanted a copy of my ID, then a bank statement proving my bank was my bank and the latest is signed letter from my bank authorising they refund me! I have visited over 100 countries and travelled on counless airlines. My advice would be avoid this airline if at all possible. It has the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

First of all, I am traveling with my 3yr old and 6 yr old from Tijuana to Cancun and booked my direct flights for the thanksgiving holiday in February. Two days before I thought I was departing I saw that my dates with my hotel stay and flight schedule were not matching up so I called the airline and they said they had to change it because the flight was either cancelled, had technical difficulties or what not. I asked them why they hadn’t sent me an email verification when this was switched and the rep on the phone said “we usually do, I don’t know what happened”. I asked what date they would have sent such an email and he didn’t have one for me to verify. The rep proceeded to tell me that unfortunately all of the direct flights were booked and the only ones they had available were ones with 6 hour layovers to and from. Since I had no choice I took it with a compensation of 1000 pesos per passenger for a future flight within 6 months with Volaris. The layover was brutal with my little boys and they ended up getting sick because of the over night layover so their fun vacation was ruined and constrained to sleeping and medicine in the hotel room for 3 days. We mentally prepared ourselves for the brutal way back and we waited it out at the airport in Mexico City from 25th to the 26th and 5am when we were supposed to board our flight back to Tijuana. At 5 am volaris announced that the flight was cancelled due to weather without further notice. They cancelled 2 more Tijuana flights after that and there were riots and very angry customers. They weren’t worried about solving the problem whatsoever. Since I was traveling with my kids I chose to hide out in the Grant Elite in Mexico City which was a saving grace. My husband was able to get a flight that wouldn’t leave Mexico City until 1:53pm and not to TJ but to Puerto Vallarta where we are supposed to get a connect to TJ but not until another 4 hour layover. We just landed in Puerto Vallarta and asked the rep if we were going to be able to take off or not for TJ with the weather, and her response was “it looks like everything is on time and weather seems good, but if anything changes we will let you know”. So now the dilemma is if we wait 4 hrs to find out we can't get to TJ another night when we could (out of our own pocket because Volaris won’t compensate anything) get a hotel for our babies to finally get some good rest after 24hr airport hell! I’m so disappointed and will never fly Volaris again. Save yourself the disappointment and pay the extra money to fly internationally and preferably not with Volaris. Beware of the CBX / TJ trap as well because they made us fork out $300 just to enter into Mexico, but when we argued we were only vacationing a week the airport immigration man said that since we were “already in line we had to pay now”. Then after a rush of people started coming he went to the immigration desk and started stamping passports — no longer making people stand in a side line to pay.",1,1,1,Not specified,Volaris

How is it possible that as an airline you do not have an option for parents traveling with toddlers? She said that it was possible that I could be charged upwards of $100 as extra luggage for his stroller or car seat, I explained but this is not luggage and I would be checking it at the gate, again she said I would have to find out cost at the airport. Again I questioned how is this possible, I need to know the cost before I decide to take it or not other than risking having to leave it behind at the airport, well apparently they do not provide that service for parents traveling with toddlers.

The phone reception was poor. I googled their other number and was put through. They booked me on a flight on Feb 25 but charged us $99.00. I felt that since the cancellation was caused by Volaris and not by me, I shouldn’t be charged. I filed a dispute with my credit card company but lost. The whole airline is pretty messed up, from the check in process which requires 3 different pieces of paper to onboard service. This is the second time I flew Volaris. The first time from Los Angeles to Guadalajara. The flight was delayed by almost 4 hours with no explanation. This time the flight was cancelled and we have to check out early from our hostel and have to pay a 50% penalty and of course no compensation. To make matter worse, my friend luggage was lost.  My friend called so many times to ask for compensation. Volaris used a contractor and the contractor refused to compensate him. In the end, he got nothing back. I have been flying frequently since 2006 and this was my worst nightmare. I feel that the airline didn’t do enough to help. The last time I flew on a Mexico carrier was on AeroMexico. The airline supposed to fly to Los Angeles but end up in Tijuana and that was it. No more Volaris. I know it is cheaper but it is not worse the trouble.

I checked in on July 5th and it took me 90 minutes to get checked in at the Volaris desk. The problem they cancelled a flight and had over 20 people complaining about it and their personnel was focus only on those passengers without taking care of the rest that were waiting. Long story short after complaining we were able to check in and needed to run to the gate because they didn't care- flight over booked. I'm flying back on Oct 4th from Austin to Mexico thru Guadalajara. I called to make sure everything was Ok with my flight and surprise the flight from Guadalajara to Mexico has been cancelled so they needed to reroute me through San Antonio - but I'm in Austin well they didn't care and won't pay for transportation, they make their problem my problem and didn't care a bit. I requested they they booked me in another airline but they rejected to do so, and they can't reimburse the ticket because it is all bought at once like round trip. To solve my problem for choosing Volaris, I needed to purchase an extra ticket with another airline from Guadalajara to Mexico City. They offered a $1,000 voucher for future flights, but would you trust Volaris again - I definitely won't. If they would care a little they had my mobile and email to contact me in advanced to solve their problem but they decided not to, they were expecting me at the counter the day of my flight to surprise me and expected me to stayed in Guadalajara for a night at my own expense. I will not recommend anybody to travel with Volaris there are other airlines options within Mexico and overseas. Lack of customer service or interest to provide any assistance to their customers. Very disappointing. Will never use Volaris again. Ground services, seats comfort, food, beverage, etc have no relevance when the main service is denied like they did which is taking you from point A to B which by the way you have already paid for it.

Mexico's budget airline is miles behind others in its class. After booking two cheap flights (chiefly because 1 free bag is included), we were greeted with the rude awakening of getting what you pay for. Horrendous customer service, shady booking practices, no legroom, dirty planes, flight attendants with attitude, and questionable pilots. We even made the mistake of booking two flights before we knew what we had done.  The first misstep we encountered was right from the get go in the booking system. They try to ""offer"" you a second bag (that they add on to the reservation by default) on top of the already free first bag for an additional $30. If you don't catch it, good luck getting any money back as Volaris customer service has a ""politic"" of no refunds even if that extra bag was never even at the airport - a fact that would easily be verified by seeing the extra bag tag was never scanned. They also seem to take up a position of passing off customer service to other departments as we called the call center's Mexican number only to have them tell us to contact them in writing. Upon doing so they tried to send us back to the call center and even gave us a US number (since we needed English assistance it would seem) that was not in service. When the written response produced no results, we were told to contact the feedback department to tell them about our experience. It was at this point we’d had had enough and felt we should warn people and help them avoid our nightmare instead.  After that, the hits just keep coming. Dirty undersized/broken trays. No legroom at all even for a 178 cm tall (5' 9"") person sitting next to us. To top it all off the flight attendants on our flight from Guadalajara to Cancun ignored us and never brought the water we asked for even when they were walking by with the drink cart. Is this assessment of Volaris' business harsh? Not likely from what we've heard, and also not from our personal experiences with them and other carriers. If we were to recommend a Mexican airline for your travels (which is also the airline our agent recommended in the first place), Interjet's legroom was fantastic, drinks were good, flight attendants were polite, and we never had a reason to deal with customer service so our rating for them is a solid A+.",1,1,1,A320,Volaris

My mother was made to believe that she mistaken about her reservation despite showing the ticket counter a screenshot of her reservation. Other patrons who complained at the same ticket counter over the exact same reason must have put up a better fight than my mother because she witness how a group of 5 women were put on a direct flight with sister airline. My mother is not the kind of person who would behave belligerent in public, I only regret not being present by her side to advocate on her behalf. She was put on a flight that had a 6 hour layover to Mexico City, only 2 days after a major earthquake , which not only made it undesirable for anyone to travel to Mexico City, it was also unsafe. She was hungry, tired, and she received no apology for the unprofessional flight experience she received. You can be sure that I will never reserve any flight with Volaris and will be sure to let everyone we know about our experience with this airline. I suggest that if Volaris sells a flight ticket, that they also inform people that their flight is subject to be changed without any notification, unless you purchase for additional amount their flight insurance .

About an hour passed and we were furious and they allowed us to check our bag - but don't worry, they charged us an extra $50 for our bag we had already brought on the way there. When we finally got into the terminal, we noticed that our flight should have been boarding, and we asked the front desk why we were not. They said they didn't know.

The second time I called, I waited on hold for 10 minutes before finally reaching someone whose English was difficult to understand, and whose phoneline was filled by background noise.

I could either take a nonstop flight departing at 8pm and getting me in to Los Angeles late at night, or I could leave at 7am in the morning for Guadalajara, and then fly from there to Los Angeles. I chose the 7am option, which required me to get up at 3:30am to get to the airport in time. All in all, it was a terrible experience. I have never had a flight cancelled like this by any other airline, and then to have the only other options be a flight very early in the morning or late at night, and to not offer to compensate me was terrible.

The legroom was VERY cramped, so it was not a top comfortable 3hr flight. There is no entertainment system, and nothing onboard is free, even water carries a price.

Talking to Volaris employees on the phone they could care less (too bad, so sad), and I'm out the cost of this nontrip, time, and cost to park near Midway Airport for 6 days. Going to the Volaris website to make a complaint is a waste of time, as this airline does not have any means to so.

Before booking our family vacation, we read a lot of reviews since we didn't know Volaris. At first I thought these negative reviews were upset passengers being vindictive. Well, they were not wrong. The 'carry-on' issue is funny. You can check in 1 bag person for free and take a carry-on (or two can't recall) but a small roller bag is considered a 'carry-on' which they will charge you $45 each way! I will say the staff in Portland slipped us a free carry-on, some points for that. In Guadalajara we knew we can't a short window to our connecting so we were running. The staff in Guadalajara seemed incompetent and even write the wrong gate. As we ran thru security, we got to the gate, but no one was there - wrong gate. By the time we figured that out, our flight left to Cancun. Next flight? 5 hours later. The uncomfortable seats are squashed and combined with the lousy flight crew added to our frustration. Finally, if you don't speak Spanish you are at a great disadvantage because most announcements were in Spanish and no repeat in English (luckily we knew how to buckle our seat belts)! Sure, this is a discount airline, which they do advertise in a loud ear-piercing message upon landing, but come on, have a little dignity!! All in all, points to the Portland staff, but I guarantee after this trip we will never use Volaris again. Too bad we have to fly home with Volaris.",1,1,0,Not specified,Volaris

I'm 6'2 and my knees were banged up against the hard back of the seat in front even before it had reclined. Would have been somewhat forgivable had the seat back not been so hard. The seat itself is also quite uncomfortable. I'd actually say this is probably the worst airline seat I've sat in. Staff are expectedly inattentive for a low cost airline. They're also very inconsistent with their decision to translate from Spanish to English - some announcements are more important than others obviously? The lady next to me on one of the flights ordered the buy-on-board nachos which looked awful (canned cheese plus corn chips) so I didn't bother with any of that.

The snacks were your choice of chips and drinks were free not just soda and juice but also beer and mix drinks. We were a party of 5 and we checked 5 bags and were all within the weight limit. Upon return 1 bag got left in Mexico City at Customs it was delivered to our home the following day. I was very sceptical about flying Volaris after reading so many negative reviews however when you are a family of 5 I had to go with the most economic.

Flight crew is well dressed and very attentive. They have recently revised baggage allowances but do offer fair pricing for additional baggage if you take the option when booking.

I don't understand who at Volaris made the decision to add these extra seats it used to be one of the most comfortable airlines in Mexico now it is an airline that I would try to avoid whenever possible. In addition and with no apparent real reason they have reduced to 15 the number of kg you can carry on your suitcase. If you exceed the limit they charge you US$8 per additional kg.

Over the last 3 years they have gone from good to horrible. I started to fly LAX to UPN flights recently. The web-site is maddening when booking an international fight. Sometimes it works sometimes it won't or asks you to call customer service. Warning - weigh your bags before you check-in. If you're one pound over you get charged $50USD. The seat pitch is 28 inches or less. Even a 2 hour flight is uncomfortable because the seats recline too far. Each time I flew UPN they gave me the wrong customs forms.

Entertainment wasn't bad though they keep airing the same shows from 6 months ago.

Additionally depending on the airport higher numbers may be boarded through the rear of the aircraft through a different gate. More attention needs to be given by the gate crew to the client. Be aware that your carry on luggage may be taken from you and checked in without any rime or reason. Airplanes are clean and onboard simple and efficient. Seating is extremely tight.

First, when departing from the Dominican Republic, they did not charge me for a carry-on bag, which was the one positive aspect of my trip. However, they made up for it by charging me simply because their system gave me an error code (404) and I couldn't download my e-ticket. Instead of offering a solution, they charged me for the ""privilege"" of printing a boarding pass. On my return from Medellín, the situation worsened. The flight attendants displayed an astonishing lack of professionalism. They attempted to charge me for a carry-on bag, which clearly fit within their sizing guidelines. I had to insist it was indeed a carry-on. Despite this, they claimed another bag was not ""purchased"" as a carry-on, forcing me to pay triple just to bring a clearly valid bag on board. Absolutely absurd. The attitude of a flight attendant was particularly disturbing—rude, condescending, and giving passengers disdainful looks paired with a hostile tone. Her behavior was not only unprofessional but also incredibly disrespectful. The most shocking incident occurred when I was forced to pay yet again for a carry-on, and this time they wouldn’t accept American Express or even U.S. cash. To add insult to injury, the attendant had the audacity to suggest I leave my bag behind and fly without it! The sheer absurdity of this situation is mind-blowing.

740106,2021-05-12,R Naylor,True,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Caracas via Bogota,March 2021,0,0,0,1,no,stay away from this airline,"Venezuelans, stay away from this airline. We bought tickets from Wingo to travel from Cancun to Caracas. For this destination the airline scheduled a long layover in Bogota. A few days before our flight, Wingo cancelled the Bogota-Caracas portion saying the airline was prevented from flying from Bogota into Venezuela. According to Wingo, this was a force majeure case. This is in no way a force majeure case. When the airline sold me the tickets they knew they were not allowed to flight from Bogota to Caracas while other direct flights from Mexico to Caracas were allowed. The airline tried everything to keep our money and escape liability. It wanted us to take the Cancun-Bogota fligh (because that one was not cancelled), leave us there and reimburse only the Bogota-Caracas portion. When we asked for a full refund to buy the tickets from another airline and be able to go to our destination, they refused saying that they were not responsible for us not being able to enter the country. We are Venezuelan citizens and at that time we were not prevented from entering into Venezuela neither due to the Covid-19 pandemic nor by any other reason. If you know that you cannot flight to a destination, you shouldn't be selling tickets to that destination with the plan to leave the passangers stranded in the layover location. The airline knew it was not going to be able to fulfill the contract as it was entered into and the customer should not be penalized for the airline's short sigh, bad planning or plain shady procedures. The airline cannot profit from its own mistakes and lack of planning. We insisted many times to get a full refund and the airline decided to close our case alleging lack of response from us. Two months later we haven't received the full reimburse nor any explanation from the airline.",0,0,0,Not specified,Wingo

(He is a Venezuelan with an expired passport, and we spoke to the airline MULTIPLE times about this and we were always told it is not a problem as many Latin American countries are letting Venezuelans travel on expired passports for 2 years). Since we were not allowed to board, we wanted to cancel and get a voucher. We were told we had to call the airline to do that. So, after holding for 30 min, we were told we couldnt cancel because it was within the 3 hour window and no cancellations are permitted . (we were at 2 hr and 45 min before takeoff to be exact). I asked to speak to a supervisor and waited another 40 min and guess what! I was told the same thing. Then I wrote them, and guess what! I was told the same thing. I have reached out to them anyway possible and I either dont get a reply or they just tell me its my fault. I understand rules, but we did everything in good faith, and they wont even give us a voucher for further travel.",0,0,0,Not specified,Wingo
714031,2020-02-16,F Jalanardo,True,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to Havana,December 2019,3,5,4,5,yes,offered excellent service,"Bogota to Havana. Since the beginning of my trip planning, Wingo offered excellent service. First of all, it was very easy to book, and as a low-cost airline where you know they will search many ways to make some extra money, they were very clear all the time with what you were able to do if you didn't want to pay more than the plane ticket. Ground service offered the Cuban visa before taking off. I found this a very good quota of service. The flight day I was surprised for them to be so punctual. We started the itinerary on time, arriving at Havana's airport earlier than expected. The seats were really comfortable considering that it is a low-cost airline, comfy legroom plus good in-flight service. They offer a menu with many options to eat in flight, and I consider they have really good prices, and they can get cheaper if you can pay in Colombian Peso due to the exchange tax. If you want to have more extra space in the seat you can pay $20 in-flight or COP 60.000. I recommend Wingo if you don't have a really big budget and if you don't care about having entertainment for international flights.",4,0,0,Boeing 737-800,Wingo

I asked them to allow me to go through migration again, since I could only do so in the company of an airline person and they told me that they would accompany me when the flight had closed. If I had counted on your collaboration I would have been able to request a copy of the card and have been able to address it in a timely manner. It makes no sense to use a low-cost airline to miss the flight. The service is terrible.  1 hora antes de abordar me informaron que las imágenes que tenía del carné de vacunación contra la fiebre amarilla no era suficientes para las autoridades de Aruba, quienes me exigirían el documento físico. Les pedí que me permitieran pasar de nuevo por migración, ya que únicamente podía hacerlo en compañía de una persona de la aerolínea y me dijeron que me acompañarían cuando el vuelo hubiera cerrado. Si hubiera contado con su colaboración hubiera podido solicitar una copia del carné y haber podido abordar en el tiempo justo. No tiene sentido usar una aerolínea de bajo costo para perder el vuelo.

Although most airlines and especially budget airlines will charge small fees to get more money out of you, this airline has it perfected. They charged us $25 dollars at the counter to print our boarding pass! I have never heard of that before. I take over 60 flights a year. You don't want to sit on the back half of the airplane? More money. You actually want to check a bag? More money. You don't want to go crazy long line takes forever?. More money. Snack? More money Exit row? More money. Actually, it was the charging $25 to print the boarding pass while counter agent laughed about it that really hurt. I was surprised there was not a coin slot on the toilet on the plane.

The airport is very small just one gate, so I was waiting in front of the gate and when I wanted to board half an hour before my flight was, they told me I couldn't board anymore. They said the door from the plane was closed. I saw the door was still open and I saw people waiting in the hall way after the gate and walking to the plane.  They said they will grab my luggage out. I asked them why they can't just let me through. They weren't helpful and they never took me seriously. Because of that I couldn't take my flight and lost my money.
